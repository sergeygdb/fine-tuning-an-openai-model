""That will be $104.01,"" the salesperson told John. ""Did you advertise it as $94.99?"" John asked angrily. He thought the salesperson was trying to take advantage of him. ""Yes, it is, but we have to add sales tax. It's the law. In California the sales tax is 9.5 percent, ""the salesperson explained. ""Why don't you just put the final price on advertisements and price tags then?"" John asked. ""Then everything seems more expensive and people won't come into the store to buy,"" the salesperson explained. ""Everything is more expensive!""

"David must have been the only kid in America that did not like summer vacation. Every year, between the beginning of June through the end of August, school kids were on vacation. Only to David, summer vacation meant work, work, and more work!  His dad was a workaholic. He had two jobs most of the time. He had one job during the day and the other at night, but sometimes he worked on weekends, too. The man had more energy than any persons alive. When he wasn't working on weekends at his third job, he worked at home and that was why David hated summer vacation.
 
His dad was always building something, or tearing something down. If he wasn't tearing down a wall, or adding a new room to the house, he was putting in a new driveway or garage. It was living hell for a 13-year-old kid. While all of David's friends were off playing baseball or riding their bicycles, he was usually hauling bricks or mixing cement. That's what he remembers about his childhood.
David always knew he was in trouble whenever he heard ""Where's David!"" His dad's voice seemed to carry down the street. That phrase could only mean it was time to get to work. Of course David learned throughout the years how to make himself disappear at just the right times, but his dad usually found him anyway. ""But dad, I want to go to the park to play with my friends,"" David would say. ""You can waste time with your buddies some other time. It's time to get to work now,"" his dad would respond. It got so bad that David would intentionally fail classes so he would have to go to summer school. Summer school was for students who didn't do well during the regular school year, but he didn't care. It meant less work. It meant freedom!

One of the children was a five-year-old boy, and the other was a girl who was one year older than Sandra. Sandra's mother and father had gone over to introduce themselves as neighbors. Sandra's mother suggested Sandra head over and do the same. Sandra was not fond of the idea. Nonetheless, Sandra's mother insisted and forced her to introduce herself to their new neighbors.
When walking over, Sandra noticed the five-year-old boy of the neighbor's family playing in the mud in their front yard. Sandra approached him and said, ""Hi, I'm Sandra. We are neighbors. What is your name?"" The boy looked up at Sandra and yelled, ""I'm Benjamin!"" He then flung a mud ball at Sandra. She screamed in shock. Benjamin's older sister then ran out of her house to see what was going on, and noticed Sandra with mud all over her shirt.
Benjamin's sister apologized to Sandra and scolded Benjamin saying, ""Benjamin, apologize! Why did you do that?"" Benjamin replied yelling, ""Because she killed my men and stepped on castle!"" Sandra then noticed she was standing right on his toy soldiers. Sandra then apologized and Benjamin's sister began to laugh at her and said, ""Don't worry about it! I'm Jessica. What's your name?"" The two began talking. It was the beginning of a new friendship.","A2"
"Last week Chris went on her first deep sea fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island. She had always enjoyed fishing when she was a child, but had never gone fishing in the ocean. Her dad liked to fish very often. Her big brother Jack was never the outdoor type, so her dad took her out often. One of his favorite spots was Lake Isabella, which was about two hours from their home. She recalls how she and her dad would spend a long, leisurely day driving to the lake, and then taking his small boat out on the water. It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Those memories remain some of her most cherished moments of her life.
 
Chris has a friend called Robert. On this day, Robert invited Chris to join him on his company's fishing trip. Robert said it wouldn't cost much, but would be a lot of fun. He knew Chris enjoyed lake fishing and figured she would have a great time. ""Okay,"" said Chris, and to the ocean they went.
The first thing Chris noticed, however, was the motion. ""Wow, this boat really rocks,"" Chris told Robert. ""Don't worry about it. You will get used to it,"" he said. The trip to the waters off Catalina Island took about an hour. Chris marveled at how quickly she lost sight of the mainland. It was a bit scary when she thought about how alone they were in this great ocean.  Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. The small boat stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean to attract the squid. Before long, thousands of squid rose to the surface and were collected for bait.
After about an hour, Chris didn't feel the rocking motion anymore. They were ready to fish. Chris caught her first ocean trout. It was a beautiful day.","A2"
"""My dad's taking us to Santa Monica today,"" said Carol. ""Do you want to go with us?"" Laura loved to go to the beach, so she said she would be happy to. Santa Monica beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. There are more scenic views on the coastline up and down the state, but many are inaccessible to beachgoers. Santa Monica has a very large beach area that features white sand and lots of room to play. Carol liked to toss a Frisbee around with her friends and to play volleyball.
 
""Do you want to play volleyball, Laura,"" Carol asked when they got there. ""Sure,"" said Laura, ""but who are we going to play with? It takes more than two people to play."" Carol thought about it, and said that they should start playing and others will join in, so the two girls started playing alone. Just as Carol said, more kids came over and wanted to play with them. Soon they had more than enough people for a game, and they played for hours.
After the game, the girls wanted to cool off, so they decided to jump into the ocean for a little relief. The water was crowded, but that just added to the fun. It was cool and wet, and the waves were just right. Some people were surfing both on surfboards and body boards, while others were swimming out to the buoys. On the coastline, two girls were digging for sea shells and one man was using his metal detector to find hidden treasure. Carol ran up to the man and asked him what he was looking for. He said: ""Anything I can find, young lady.' Carol laughed and asked him if she could try. ""Sure. Why not?"" said the man. So Carol started scanning the beach and soon found a necklace, whcih the man let her keep. ""Why not,"" said the man. ""You found it."" Carol was very happy and ran to tell Laura.","A2"
"Hi, Fred!
It's been a while since we have been in touch. How has your semester been?
I wanted to send you an email update to you let you know how things have been going during my semester abroad here in Málaga, Spain. I've already been here for six weeks, and I feel like I am finally adapting to the culture. I'm also speaking the language more fluently.
I arrived during the first week of September. The weather has been very nice. Even though it's October, it's still rather sunny and warm. In fact, I went to the beach and swam in the Mediterranean Sea earlier today.
I am living with a very welcoming host family. I have my own private bedroom, but we eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner together. On Sundays, we eat a big home-cooked paella for lunch. In Spain, lunch is usually the biggest meal of the day. It's also very common for the people to take a midday nap right after a big meal. I am actually just waking up from my nap right now!
On weekdays, I take classes at the local university. There, I met several native Spanish speakers. They have been very kind and patient with me. At first, I struggled to comprehend their Spanish, but now I understand most of our conversations. They have commented that my Spanish has improved a lot since we first met. Now, I am more confident to use the language in other places like stores and restaurants.
I am so glad that I decided to spend the semester here in Spain. We have an extended weekend coming up, so a group of my friends and I are going to travel to France for four days. It's so easy and inexpensive to travel internationally in Europe. I love it!
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Like I said, don't hesitate to stay in touch more often. Perhaps you could even come to visit! What do you think?
Best wishes,
Patrick","A2"

""Because those two trees are a fire hazard,"" said the fire control agent. ""All trees are a fire hazard,"" said Diane. ""Yes, but those two trees are a super fire hazard,"" said the agent. ""Why are those two trees a super fire hazard?"" Diane asked. ""Because those two trees are right next to your house. Chop them down,"" he said. Diane was poor. She couldn't afford to pay someone to chop the trees down. The agent said, ""Chop them down, or I will fine you."" The next day, she poured gasoline on both trees. Then she set them on fire.","A2"

"Do you have a favorite genre of music?
No, but I have favorite bands.
What bands would you consider your favorites?
The Beatles are the first. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are the second.
Is that all?
No, I really like The Clash. They are third.
I've only heard of The Beatles.
You should check out the other two bands. They are good.

"Robert Lee and his brothers were excited about the new ""Godzilla"" movie that was coming out. The day the movie came out, Robert and his brothers went to the theater early. Robert's brothers wanted to see another movie first, and then they wanted to sneak into ""Godzilla."" Robert didn't mind, because he liked going to the movies. When they got to the theater, Robert bought his brothers popcorn, soda, and some candy. When they got everything, they went to find their seats.
 
Robert's brothers didn't really like the first movie they watched, but they were excited to see ""Godzilla."" When they got out of the first movie, Robert went to get more soda and popcorn, because his brothers had finished all of it. Robert's brothers snuck into the theater, and they were waiting for Robert to come back with the snacks. When Robert tried to go back in to see ""Godzilla"", a security guard asked him for his ticket. Robert didn't have one for ""Godzilla,"" so the security guard had to kick him out.
Robert had to go outside and buy another ticket for ""Godzilla."" He felt embarrassed, because he had to stand in the line with the popcorn and soda. The people in line and the people who worked in the ticket booth looked at Robert and found him funny. Robert knew that they were looking at him, because they knew he got kicked out for trying to sneak into another movie. His face turned red. He thought about calling his brothers to get out, so that they could go home. Robert thought about how his brothers wanted to see the movie too, and so he bought the ticket and went back in. The security guard looked at him again, and asked him for his ticket. Robert showed it to him, and went into the theater. The security guard laughed.","A2"

"Donald Turner wanted to get a job. He had graduated from his university with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. Since his graduation, he had applied for 20 jobs, yet no one had called him back. Donald decided to be an accountant two years ago, because he figured that it would be an easier way to earn money. Although Donald had studied to become an accountant, his real passion was painting.
 
Donald took some art classes at his university. His teacher told him that he had the talent, but needed to commit more to his painting. Even though Donald was interested, he decided to play it safe and focus his study on becoming an accountant. He passed his art classes as well as his business classes, all with As. He was proud of his grades. However, two years had passed, Donald still could not find a job. He began getting frustrated.
In order to calm himself down, Donald began painting. He would go to apply for jobs in the morning, and then come back home and paint. When Donald began feeling really stressed out, he would go out to the park and paint there. One day, when Donald was painting at the park, a man began watching him paint. Donald didn't see the man the whole time he was there.
When Donald finished the painting, the man went to talk to him. ""You have some real talent,"" the man said. Donald chuckled and said thanks. The man wanted to know if Donald was selling the painting. Donald was surprised. He didn't think anyone would want to buy his paintings. Donald said yes, and the man offered him $1,500 for the painting. Donald almost dropped the painting because he couldn't believe it. After Donald sold the painting, he bought art supplies with the money he received. He decided to forget about being an accountant. He had never felt so happy.","A2"

"Rob Hernandez thought the fuzzy little chick at the pet shop was the cutest thing he had ever seen. He had to buy it. He thought he was buying a baby duck, and named his new pet Chaco. Chaco was loved and grew fast. Rob began to notice, however, that Chaco was growing too fast and getting too big. When Chaco made his first sound, Rob couldn't believe his ears. Rob expected a quack, but Chaco honked. Chaco was no duck. Chaco was a goose.
 
Rob didn't reject Chaco though. He kept him as long as he could. Chaco was not a quiet goose. He made a lot of noise, honking day and night. Rob's neighbors started to complain. Rob didn't want to give Chaco up, but he couldn't risk his neighbors calling the police on him either. Rob had to make a decision.
Rob decided to take Chaco to a nearby park that had a lake with other geese. Rob felt sad leaving Chaco and he was pretty sure his feathered friend felt sad, too. Rob goes twice a week to the park to visit Chaco so that both the goose and the owner are less sad. When Rob goes to visit, Chaco swims across the lake right into Rob's arms. Sometimes, Chaco will even give Rob a little peck, a goose's way of giving a kiss.
When Rob goes to visit, he always brings snacks for Chaco. The other geese seemed to be jealous of all the attention Chaco was getting, so now Rob brings enough bread for all the geese to share. Rob and Chaco also play. Rob throws his former pet into the lake. Chaco goes underwater, swims a little, and then returns to the shore so that Rob can throw him in again.","A2"
"Dennis had always been a terrible student. When he was a kid, his parents sent him to a Catholic school. He didn't know much about the school. Of course he didn't know much about anything when he was 6 years old, but he did know one thing -- all his friends from the neighborhood went to a public school. Dennis was the only boy that went to a private school, and his friends would often tease him about it. ""You're not one of us! You're not one of us,"" they would sometimes chant. He wasn't really alone, though. His friend Patricia also went to the Catholic school, but she was a girl. After a while, they began walking to the small school together every morning. Pat was the first girl friend Dennis had ever had. She wasn't his girlfriend. She was just a friend who happened to be a girl.
 
The nuns at the school were very mean. They ruled the school like it was a prison. Dennis was afraid to even raise his hand to ask a question. His mother was often called into meetings with the principal about Dennis, who would also sit in the office listening to the principal telling his mother how smart he was, but was very lazy. Needless to say, Dennis didn't do well in school and ended up going to a junior college after high school. He didn't do very well there either, and soon dropped out.
That all changed after Dennis grew up and started working. He had worked for many years before deciding he wanted to earn a degree after all. Dennis went back to school at the age of 30, and soon was a college graduate with a degree. It turned out Dennis wasn't as lazy as those nuns thought he was.","A2"
"Age doesn't matter when it comes to helping out the needy. Shane is a 9-year-old boy that loves to help out. During a school field trip, Shane's class went to visit a warehouse where people donate food and clothes for the homeless. Shane was inspired by the workers he saw there. When he got home, he told his mom all about his field trip. Shane told his mom that he wanted to go help out.
 
A week later, Shane's mom told him the good news. They were going to help out at a local kitchen that gave food to the homeless. Shane got excited. He got his coat and shoes. As Shane and his mom were getting to the local kitchen, Shane saw how all the homeless people were living. He saw the tents in the street and how some people didn't even have shoes. He got sad, and told his mom that he was going to make sure everyone had shoes, food, and blankets.
When they got inside, the manager of the kitchen thanked Shane and his mom for coming down to help. They started serving food to the homeless and everyone that passed by thanked Shane for coming down to help. Shane felt safe and started talking to the homeless people. He told them that he wanted to help them. When they finished, Shane didn't want to leave, but they had to.
Shane told his mom that he wanted to do more. During school, Shane asked his teacher to let him say something to the class. He told them about what he had seen. He asked his friends and his teacher if they had any clothes they didn't wear anymore, so that he could donate them. His friends brought some clothes the next day, but his teacher did something better. She brought her friend, who was a reporter, and ran a story on Shane about how much he wanted to help out the homeless. Thousands of people donated clothes and food.

"Kim was a housekeeper for a family in Beverly Hills. One morning when she went to work, she found a note from her boss. The note asked her to go to the supermarket and pick up a few things. There was a list of things Kim was supposed to buy. The note surprised Kim. She had only been a housekeeper for a week and had never been asked to go shopping before. Kim didn't even know where the nearest grocery store was. She also didn't know how to drive. Thankfully the note also told her that the boss's driver would take her to the market. There was also a $50 bill.
 
Once at the market Kim walked through looking for the items on her list. She was confused though. The list read ""one pound of apples"". Kim had purchased one kilogram of apples but never a pound. In her country, they used the metric system. She wasn't sure if a pound was more or less than a kilogram. Kim decided to ask one of the grocery workers. The grocery worker was kind and explained that a pound was about half a kilogram.
""I wouldn't worry about it though. Just use the scale,"" the grocery worker. Kim went to the scale and was happy to see that the scales didn't use the metric system she was used to. Kim weighed a pound of apples and put it in the shopping cart.
The next item on the list was a gallon of milk. Kim wasn't sure how much a gallon was. She was used to buying a liter of milk. There was also no way to weigh a liter of milk. She was glad that the milk containers were labeled. She just wished the U.S. used the metric system.","A2"

"Rocky was a big baseball fan. He lived in Philadelphia, but was originally from Los Angeles. He made sure to go watch the Dodgers every time they played the Phillies. Rocky will never forget the last game he saw at Citizen's Bank Ballpark, which is where the Phillies play.
 
It started off as a normal game for Rocky. He sat out in the stands with his girlfriend. He was fully dressed as a Dodgers fan. He had a Dodgers hat, jersey, and shirt. As the game came to the seventh inning, which is the seventh inning stretch and everyone starts singing ""Take me out to the Ballpark,"" he noticed that the Dodgers pitcher Josh Beckett had been pitching a no-hitter. A no-hitter is when a pitcher doesn't allow a player on the other team to get a hit. Rocky got excited, because he never would have thought he would see a no-hitter, especially the Dodgers pitch a no-hitter.
Rocky was holding on to his beer, but he wasn't drinking it. He was watching the baseball game very closely. His girlfriend would talk, but he wouldn't listen. As Beckett threw the final pitch, Rocky held his breath. He saw that it was a strike and jumped out of his chair. He even spilled some of his beer on his girlfriend, but she didn't care. She was happy as well. Rocky was thrilled. He started yelling loudly. He celebrated with other Dodger fans that were there and drank the rest of his beer.
When he got home, Rocky turned on the television. He put the highlights of the game on ESPN and saw that he had come out on television. His girlfriend saw it and was excited. It was the best ending to the best baseball game he had ever been to.","A2"
"His friends used to call him Hoss, as in Hoss Cartwright from the TV show Bonanza. At 62 and roughly 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once resembled the big, friendly character.
Now, they call him The Beast. 
The nickname is apt. Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon. He's completed an Olympic-distance triathlon and lost more than 100 pounds. And on August 26, he 'll participate in his first full-length Ironman competition in Louisville, Kentucky.
Like they say, he's a beast.
 What he does after this Ironman, I do n't know, his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh. I hope he can find something to focus all this energy on. 
From Rucker's DailyMile blog: April 18, 2011 -- First day of the Couch to 5K program. That was not good. But at least I did the whole workout -LRB- 1.98 miles / 32 minutes / 16:10 pace -RRB-
Change is a funny thing, Rucker says. Often, the desire to change grows over time. A series of events leads to an a ha moment, when desire must meet with the proper tools and the right inspiration.
In the summer of 2010, Rucker, of Lexington, Kentucky, and his family went to Dollywood in Tennessee. His daughter was 11 at the time, a little daredevil, and wanted to ride all the roller coasters. Unfortunately, Rucker could n't fit on any of them with her.
 She was devastated; I was crushed, Rucker said. But even that was n't enough to get me started on the journey. I guess I just did n't know how to do it. 
Does parenting make us fat ?
In January 2011, he reconnected with an old elementary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing Mills240-pound weight loss.
Her transformation was his inspiration. But he still was n't ready to change.
After weighing in at about 365 pounds, he stopped stepping on the scale. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and put on medication for high blood pressure. He feared that he was diabetic but would n't visit his doctor.
The day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain. Once again, he had overindulged the night before, and his digestive system revolted. He was tired, sick and unhappy.
 Something clicked, he said. I realized that if I kept doing it, I would significantly shorten my life. 
Rucker took Millsdieting hints to heart and cut out sugary drinks. He dropped his two-liter-a-day soda habit and picked up water. He stopped ordering McDonald's McGriddles for breakfast and eating peanut M&M s by the pound. He threw away his Cheez-Its.
 It's hard to say what my daily -LRB- calorie -RRB- intake was, he said, looking back. I did it to myself. I was really unhappy with the way my life was, and I think food was that comfort for me. 
June 19, 2011 -- Last day of Couch 2 5K. I think I 'll call it The Father's Day Beastly 5K. I was the only competitor and I finished in 1st place. I ca n't even begin to explain how I feel right now. And no one or no thing can ever take this away from me. I AM a runner. I AM an achiever. I AM a Beast. On to Bridge 2 10K !!! 
Rucker's job as a real estate attorney kept him sedentary. So he started to walk on his lunch break, using his iPhone to post his distance on DailyMile.com. The site shared his progress on Twitter and Facebook. Friends posted replies that the site's app read aloud to Rucker through his headphones during workouts.
Wiring the world to fight obesity
 That was a huge motivator to me, he said. Even though I was by myself, I still had people to encourage me. 
He ran his first official 5K race, the Great Buffalo Chase, on July 4, 2011, in 39 minutes. Less than a month later, he tackled a 10K, finishing dead last but finishing all the same. His blog that night complained about the cross-country course's hills but promised to begin training for a half-marathon the next day.
 The focus he has, the drive he has... it's so refreshing, Annita Rucker said. It's the old Mark I did n't even know -- probably the Mark from law school. 
The Ruckers married in October 2000. For 11 years, Annita Rucker watched the man she married -- the dreamer, the achiever -- struggle to maintain his optimism while grappling with a shrinking housing market and a growing body.
Their son and daughter -- two children from Rucker's first marriage -- came to visit often, and Annita Rucker found herself entertaining the young kids while her husband remained stationary.
 I used to complain that he was living life on the sidelines, never participating, she said. Now, he's so active with them. Last year, my father had Parkinson's and was hospitalized for 10 weeks. Mark stepped up to the plate and did all the cooking, the laundry, everything. Before this, that never would have happened. 
 My wife jokes, I 've got a brand new husband, Rucker said with a long laugh. I think she's a lot happier with me... because I 'm much happier. 
August 18, 2011 -- Three mile walk at work on my lunch break. Some days I got ta dig down deep to find the motivation. Some days it's really hard. Today is one of those days. 
Rucker is now training for his first Ironman competition. A typical week includes 4:30 a.m. swims, 6-mile runs after work and hours of cycling on Saturday and Sunday. At 260 pounds, he's stopped focusing on losing weight and started focusing on building muscle.
There are good and bad days. Some blog posts sing of the serotonin rushing through his brain. Others show his discouragement of a bad swim or a slow run. He's a beast, but one who feels pain.
Ironman champ: The importance of R&R
Still, it's amazing, even to him, that a guy who less than two years ago got winded walking up a flight of stairs can push himself this far, this fast.
 I 'm the guy in the overalls -LRB- who's -RRB- shoveling the coal in the train, he said. I do n't know exactly where it's going, but I 'm going to do everything I can to keep it moving. 
February 18, 2012 -- Woot woot !! I 'm a marathoner !! -LRB- 26.4 miles / 6 hours, 13 minutes / 14:07 pace -RRB-
Rucker has rejoined the social world. He volunteers at the Red Cross and is involved in his local Rotary chapter. This year, his family went back to Dollywood and rode all the rides together.
Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him. Possible title for his speech: Be the Beast that you can be. 
 When I was so overweight, I felt so dead to everything, Rucker said. There was this little voice in my head that said, for so long, This is the best your life is ever going to be.And that voice is gone. I 've extinguished that voice.

After a week had passed by, David seemed to be getting used to working at the Burger Hut. Michael was impressed with how hard David worked, and told him he could take a day off.
During his day off, David went out with his friends. They went to the park and played some basketball, and then his friends decided to go get something to eat. David asked them where they wanted to go. They said they wanted to go eat at the Burger Hut. David tried to convince them to go somewhere else, but his friends really wanted to go to the Burger Hut.
When they got to the Burger Hut, David put on his sweater and his hat. He sat down in the far corner of the restaurant, and tried to hide himself from his co-workers and his boss. When his friends got their food, they went to sit down with David. Michael came out and saw David. He went up to him and said, ""You just can't get enough of this place, huh, David?"" Michael chuckled and then left. David's friends took a bite out of their burgers, and looked at David. ""You work here?"" One of David's friend asked. His another friend looked at him and said, ""Can you get me a job?"" David smiled and nervously said, ""I'll try.""","A2"
"I was 10 years old when we first got a computer. I didn't know what to do with it, so I just played video games on it. My brother was six years older than me, so he would use the computer to go into chat rooms. After we had had the computer for around a year, I noticed my brother would always be in chat rooms. He would always have a private message open as well. It took me another year to realize that my brother was dating someone online.
 
I always knew my brother's girlfriend as SnowBunny85, because he never told us officially that she was his girlfriend. I later found out her name was Lily. My brother always tried to be careful not to leave any pictures Lily sent him on the desktop of the computer, but sometimes he would. She looked pretty. I didn't understand why my brother wanted, or felt that he needed to keep his relationship secret.
A few years later, my brother told me that he had broken up with a girlfriend he had. I asked why, but he didn't want to talk about it. I found out what really happened one day while I was using the computer. My brother had saved his last conversation with Lily. It seemed like Lily had lied to my brother. They had met a couple of times in real life, and they seemed to have had a real relationship. The only problem was that Lily already had a husband. My brother was crushed to find out that she was married. On that day I realized that an online relationship is risky. It's up to you to find someone that you can trust and hopefully isn't lying to you. I hope my brother realized that, too.","A2"

It's a dead bug.
It's all squished and messy.

I do, but I really can't.

"Tina was very involved in her daughter's education. She made sure her daughter did her homework. She also volunteered at her school. She especially liked to help parents who did not speak English. Tina often would translate at parent-teacher conferences and meetings. She also translated some of the papers that the school sent home. Tina was a member of the parent-teacher association. She went to every meeting and open forum. Tina was so active in her daughter's school that she was elected to be vice-president of the parent-teacher association.
 
The principal of the school did not like Tina though. She felt Tina was too involved. She didn't like how Tina insisted that there be translation at every meeting, and that every paper that went home be in different languages. The principal felt Tina was creating more work for her and her staff. She thought Tina was a troublemaker.
The way Tina looked didn't help her. She had many tattoos, and often dyed her hair in non-traditional colors like pink and green. One evening, after Tina's daughter received an award for her good grades, Tina went up to greet the principal. The principal responded coldly: ""Congratulations."" The principal then offered some advice to Tina's daughter. ""When you grow up, don't become like your mother,"" the principal told the young girl. The little girl was confused. Tina was furious. How dare the principal speak to her that way? Tina may not have looked like all the other parents, but what she looked like shouldn't matter. Tina's daughter hugged her mother. ""I don't care that you have green hair, mommy,"" she said, ""I care that you care about me and my school.""","A2"

"""Hello Dolly"" is one of the classic American plays. It was first shown in New York City in 1964 and won 10 Tony Awards. The Tony Awards are live theater's version of the Oscars. When I was in high school, our theater department decided to put on our version of ""Hello Dolly"", and I just had to get involved. I wasn't an actor, but I was hoping there was something I could do, so I went to the director and asked him if he needed help. To my surprise, he said yes!
 
The director's name was Michael Thomas. I almost screamed in delight when he said I could be a part of the play. ""Oh, my god!"" I said. ""I would love to be a stagehand. Are you kidding me?"" A stagehand is someone who moves all the props and background in between acts. It is precision work that takes coordination between several people. I loved working in the ""wings"", which is what the backstage in called in theater lingo. The stage manager is the person who runs the backstage during a play, and the job carries a lot of responsibility. My first stage manager was a cool guy who liked me a lot, so I got the best assignments. ""Hey George, how would you like to man the lighting?"" he asked, and I jumped at the opportunity.
""You bet, boss!"" I responded. That was how I got put in charge of the lighting for one of the best plays ever written. Even though this was just a high school production, we played to packed houses almost every night we were on. I did such a great job that when the theater department decided to put on ""West Side Story"" the next semester, they asked me if I wanted to join the team. It was such an honor to be selected, so of course my answer was yes!","A2"
"one day, Abel opened his refrigerator and gasped when he noticed there wasn't anything in there. ""Who ate all the food?"" Abel asked his brother Mel, who was in the living room sitting down on the couch watching cartoons. ""You probably woke up in the middle of the night and ate it all!"" Mel humorously responded. Abel was not amused. His stomach was growling and he had no time for Mel's childish quips. ""I'm so hungry! I could eat a horse!"" Abel proclaimed. ""I bet you can easily eat two,"" Mel jokingly said. ""You are so funny,"" Abel sarcastically replied.
 
Abel thought of ordering a pepperoni pizza by phone, but soon realized he had only five dollars. He needed ten dollars to make the purchase. He was short by five dollars. Abel asked his brother if he could pitch in for the rest, but he had no cash. ""Are you even hungry?"" Abel asked Mel. ""I already ate,"" Mel said. This made Abel jealous and a bit angry. ""What did you eat?"" Abel inquired, with furrowed brows. ""A ten-dollar Pizza,"" Mel casually replied. ""You must be kidding,"" Abel said, almost yelling. Mel just sat there watching a recording of an episode from The Simpsons.
""When is mom coming back?"" Abel asked Mel. ""I don't know"" he replied. Abel could now only hope that his mom would come to the rescue and bring a large fresh pizza from Pizza Mountain. Abel plopped down next to Mel on the couch and started watching television with him. They both laughed out loud at the cartoon's funny characters. Abel was enjoying himself so much that he had forgotten that he was hungry. Then commercials began playing. Abel's stomach started calling for food again. ""I'm going to starve to death,"" Abel said, as the front door to his house started opening. ""I'm back, and I brought pizza!"" Abel's mom said as she came in through the door. Abel could not wait to get his hands on the pizza.","A2"

"Hi Lucia
How are you? It was so nice to meet you last week in Sydney at the sales meeting. How was the rest of your trip? Did you see any kangaroos? I hope you got home to Mexico City OK.
Anyway, I have the documents about the new Berlin offices. We're going to be open in three months. I moved here from London just last week. They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect. There are lots of restaurants, cafés and banks in the area. There's also public transport; we are next to an U-Bahn (that is the name for the metro here). Maybe you can come and see them one day? I would love to show you Berlin, especially in the winter. You said you have never seen snow – you will see lots here!
Here's a photo of you and me at the restaurant in Sydney. That was a very fun night! Remember the singing Englishman? Crazy! Please send me any other photos you have of that night. Good memories.
Please give me your email address and I will send you the documents.
Bye for now

"When I was 13 years old, I loved playing the drums. I guess banging on the drums gave me an emotional outlet for a very troubled time in my youth. When you're 13, everything seems to come at you from all directions. The drums helped me cope with being a teenager. One day, I called my friend Rudy on the phone. Rudy loved playing around with his guitar. Neither one of us had ever taken music lessons, but we loved our instruments. ""Hey Rudy, why don't you come over? We can play for a while,"" I suggested. ""No problem, man. If it's okay with you, I'll bring my cousin Bobby with me. He plays the bass guitar."" I told him that would be great and waited for them to arrive.
 
Bobby didn't just play the bass, he jammed at it. ""You're really rock on that bass, Bobby,"" I told him. He said he had been playing for years and wanted to form a band. We all looked at each other, and it hit us like a bolt of lightning. ""We can do this!"" Rudy and I said at the same time. ""All we need is a vocalist,"" I said, to which Bobby chirped, ""I can do that, too!"" That was the beginning of the best Rock ‘N' Roll band ever – ""The Coke Bottles"". Of course that was an exaggeration, but it turned out we were pretty good for a bunch of novices.
The three of us began meeting at my place every week to practice playing together and to bounce song ideas off each other. Bobby could actually sing. With Rudy and me putting in all those hours of practice, we got pretty good. We got so good that we played at a couple of parties and at a free Concert in the Park festival about a year later. That was as far as we got though. Rudy joined the Army the following year. Bobby and I were never able to find another lead guitarist, so the greatest Rock ‘N' Roll band ""The Coke Bottles"" never made it big, but that was okay with me. We had our day in the sun.","A2"
"One of the first things Gustav wanted to do when he got to the United States was to see as much of it as he could. He would be flying into New York City's John F. Kennedy airport. In New York he planned to see the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. Then he wanted to go to Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell. Then he wanted to go to the nation's capital, Washington D.C., where he hoped to see the White House, and maybe he would even see President. He knew that getting to the three east coast cities was pretty easy. He could take a train or bus.
 
Gustav wasn't sure though about how he would get to the other parts of the United States he wanted to see. For example, Gustav really wanted to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He also really wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of his favorite movie stars lived.
Once in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C. ""What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?"" Gustav asked. ""What about them?"" the concierge asked, looking confused. ""What about trips there?"" Gustav asked. The concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. ""A train there will take you about a week. A plane ride will take about six hours,"" the concierge explained. Gustav was disappointed. He had no idea that the United States was such a large country. He was determined to see as much as he could though. He wondered how much it would cost to rent a camper and drive it across the U.S.","A2"

Learning to drive seemed scary for Joel at first. He had recently purchased his first car, which was now sitting on his driveway, looking clean and shiny. The previous owner had maintained it for years and had spent a lot of money restoring it to its original condition. The car was a BMW, made in the year 1984. It was black and had only two doors. The interior was also black and had leather seating. The vehicle looked practically new to Joel, despite it being older than the new owner of it.
 
Joel was eager to start driving his new car. At 21, Joel had felt the need to be driving already. He was attending college in the city of Los Angeles, working at a bookstore in the city of Montebello, and living in the city of Bell. Having a car would make traveling much more convenient. Joel had been getting around by means of public transportation. He was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.
The first thing Joel had to do was to go to DMV to register the car under his name. After that, he took a driving manual book from DMV to study for the written test. Passing the written test was the only way to get a driving permit. Joel studied for a few days, and passed his test. With the permit in hand, Joel next had to find someone to teach him how to drive.
Joel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. ""If I'm going to teach you how to drive, you're going to have to commit 100 percent. Do you understand?"" Joel's uncle asked him. ""Yes, sir,"" responded Joel. After a month full of trial and error, Joel finally learned how to drive his car. Although it was scary at first, driving eventually became easy enough for Joel.","A2"

"""You're a Winner!"" That's what Helen Green read as she opened an envelope she got in the mail. She couldn't believe it. She had won. Helen's husband Roger came over to see why Helen was screaming and jumping. Helen told Roger ""You're not going to believe it. Your sister entered us in a sweepstakes for a Hawaii vacation, and we won. We won, Roger!"" Roger didn't believe it at first, but then he researched it. ""Well, I guess we're going to Hawaii, honey,"" he told Helen. They both started jumping with joy.
 
Helen and Roger arrived at Hawaii, and couldn't believe how beautiful everything looked. They had been married for 20 years, but had never had a vacation. After they had checked into their hotel room, they decided to go to the beach. They met a surfer named William, although he liked to be called Will, who was offering free lessons. Seeing that Roger had always wanted to learn how to surf, they decided to go. Will explained to Roger how to paddle the surf board, and he taught him how to stand up on it. After two hours of training in the sand, Will told Roger that they would go out to the water. Roger didn't like that.
""Where are we going?"" Roger nervously asked. ""Over there,"" said Will, as he pointed to the ocean. He started getting nervous, and started breathing heavy. Helen went over to Roger and calmed him down. ""They're probably in their honeymoon,"" people said as they passed Roger and Helen. Roger laughed. He finally calmed down. He went out to the ocean with Will, and tried to surf. Every time he tried to get on the surf board he ended up falling. When they got back to the land, Helen hugged Roger and kissed him. ""You did great, honey. I love you,"" Helen said. Roger knew she was lying, but he had never seen Helen smile so greatly. He let it go.","A2"
"Helen was outside watering her lawn like she does every other day. She loves her lawn and her garden. She has the prettiest house on the block, but it's only because she works at it very hard. Helen is in her mid-40s but you wouldn't know it by looking at her. Her face is nearly wrinkle-free, and it seems she has more energy than people half her age.
 
""Good morning, Helen."" I said as I walked outside on my way to work. ""Hi Robert, how are you?"" she asked. ""Fine! I'm doing fine. Your yard is looking good,"" I said. And it was. Sometimes it really bothers me that I can't get my lawn to look as nice as hers. ""What's your secret, Helen?"" I asked. ""Secret to what?"" She answered. ""To having such a beautiful lawn!  I water mine, I seed mine every year and I still can't get it to look as good as yours. I'm jealous!"" I said with a smile. Helen just nodded and had this funny little look on her face that suggested she was just better at keeping her lawn nice than I was.
I didn't like that look, but I guess it's okay that she feels that way. I've known Helen since she was a little girl and things have not gone well with her lately. She's been alone for a long time. She wasn't very pretty when she was young. She had terrible acne that covered her face from ear to ear. It made her very self-conscious so she didn't go out on dates very much, but that all changed when she met Josh. They were together for more than 10 years until, sadly, they went their separate ways. Since then, Helen has nurtured and tended her garden as if it were her child.
When I got home later that day, she was outside working on her roses. I said hello to her as I walked to my door, and she smiled brightly. She looked beautiful.","A2"
"My last holiday
My last holiday was a five-day trip to Prague in the Czech Republic. I know Prague well because I lived there when I was at university, more than ten years ago.
Instead of staying in a hotel, I stayed with one of my old friends. It was so much fun, and a little bit like my old life. I wanted to do all the same things I did in my university days, so I visited the university. It has changed a lot and looks more modern. I also went to the supermarket near my old house. I loved seeing all the different foods. I was really happy to find my favourite cheese and chocolate biscuits but they were a bit more expensive than I remember!
We did some touristy things too. We walked up beautiful Petrin Hill and around the castle. The views of the city are amazing up there. We walked across the historic Charles Bridge. My friend's flat is very near the TV Tower so we saw the famous baby statues climbing up it. Those things haven't changed, of course.","A2"

Robert was inspired. He went to the tryouts at school the next day. Even though Robert was the smallest person at the tryouts, he didn't give up. When the coach looked at Robert and asked him what he was doing there. ""I'm here to tryout, coach,"" Robert said. The coach wanted to laugh, Robert knew it, but the coach stopped himself. ""Okay, let's see what you got,"" the coach said. He gave him a bat. Robert stepped up to bat. The pitcher threw the ball, and Robert swung as hard as he could. After he opened his eyes, Robert noticed that he had missed the ball. This happened two more times, and then he was out.
The coach went out to talk to Robert: ""Sorry, son. This sport is not for everyone."" Robert didn't understand. He felt angry and sad. He thanked the coach for the opportunity, and started walking off the field. Then he heard some of the guys making fun of him for being small. Robert couldn't take it anymore. He started running home. The coach saw Robert start running and couldn't believe how fast he was running. Robert was running faster than the team's fastest player. The coach told his assistant, ""Go to the office and get me the home number for that kid."" Robert got home, and his dad told him the good news. He had gotten on the team. Robert couldn't believe it. He heard the coach's message, ""Sorry, for not believing in you, Speedy. Welcome to the team.""","A2"
"Kobe Bryant is a professional basketball player, who played his entire career with the Los Angeles Lakers. He first joined the team as a 17-year-old teenager in 1996. During the time, Bryant led the Lakers to five National Basketball Association titles. The most recent championship was in 2010, when the Lakers beat their arch rival, the Boston Celtics. The Lakers also won seven western conference titles and eight Pacific Division titles during Bryant's time.
 
The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA. They have appeared in 31 championship finals, more than any other teams in the league. The team has won more regular season games than any other franchise. It is clearly one of the premier NBA organizations, which came into existence in 1946.
Before Bryant, the Lakers already had some of the most notable superstars the league has ever known. Players such as George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Magic Johnson. Bryant had been central in establishing, and maintaining the legacy of this great team. He is the latest, and possible greatest of them all.
His individual statistics are astounding. He is the youngest player ever to score 30,000 points. He has been selected to the NBA's All Star team every year he has played, with the exception of his rookie season. He has won two Olympic Gold Medals in Basketball, leading the United States Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing, and in the London games of 2012. In 2006, Bryant became the 2nd player in the history of the game to score more than 80 points in a single game. Only Chamberlain has scored more. He holds several Laker individual records, including most seasons played, most All Star selections, most points scored, and most playoff games played.","B1"
"(1) Fairies today are the stuff of children's stories, little magical people with wings, often shining with light. Typically pretty and female, like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, they usually use their magic to do small things and are mostly friendly to humans.
(2) We owe many of our modern ideas about fairies to Shakespeare and stories from the 18th and 19th centuries. Although we can see the origins of fairies as far back as the Ancient Greeks, we can see similar creatures in many cultures. The earliest fairy-like creatures can be found in the Greek idea that trees and rivers had spirits called dryads and nymphs. Some people think these creatures were originally the gods of earlier, pagan religions that worshipped nature. They were replaced by the Greek and Roman gods, and then later by the Christian God, and became smaller, less powerful figures as they lost importance.
(3) Another explanation suggests the origin of fairies is a memory of real people, not spirits. So, for example, when tribes with metal weapons invaded land where people only used stone weapons, some of the people escaped and hid in forests and caves. Further support for this idea is that fairies were thought to be afraid of iron and could not touch it. Living outside of society, the hiding people probably stole food and attacked villages. This might explain why fairies were often described as playing tricks on humans. Hundreds of years ago, people actually believed that fairies stole new babies and replaced them with a 'changeling' – a fairy baby – or that they took new mothers and made them feed fairy babies with their milk.
(4) While most people no longer believe in fairies, only a hundred years ago some people were very willing to think they might exist. In 1917, 16-year-old Elsie Wright took two photos of her cousin, nine-year-old Frances Griffiths, sitting with fairies. Some photography experts thought they were fake, while others weren't sure. But Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes detective stories, believed they were real. He published the original pictures, and three more the girls took for him, in a magazine called The Strand, in 1920. The girls only admitted the photos were fake years later in 1983, created using pictures of dancers that Elsie copied from a book.","B1"
"NASA will launch Space Shuttle Endeavour on February 7, which will be the first of five launches this year before the shuttle fleet is retired.
Endeavour will blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a 13-day mission to the international space station.
The mission will include three spacewalks, NASA said. The shuttle will also deliver the final U.S. portion of the space station. This portion will provide more room for crew members.
NASA plans to retire its space shuttles Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis later this year.
The space agency has been looking for places, such as museums, to house the shuttles after they are retired.
Space Shuttle Discovery will be transferred to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
The privilege of showing off a shuttle wo n't be cheap -- about $29 million, NASA said.

"March 14 is my favorite day to be a nerd.
Across the country, math geeks in museums, schools, private groups and elsewhere gather to celebrate the number pi, approximately 3.14. That's why March 14 -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day. What's more, Albert Einstein was born on this day.
A quick refresher: Pi is defined as the distance around a perfect circle, or the circumference, divided by the distance across it, or the diameter. It is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences.
Throughout history, people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple division on your calculator. What's more, its digits go on infinitely, without any pattern in the numbers. 3.1415926535897932... etc.. Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music.
On Pi Day, one number reeks of mystery '
Math may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day. One might even say -- gasp ! -- it's cool to like pi these days. Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009.
In countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi. And so Pi Day is an acquired taste, mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail.
Conveniently, pi sounds like pie, and pies are round. You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza. If you 're in enrolled in school, your math class or math department might be doing something special already.
But if you happen to live in a particularly pi-happy place, you might be able to take part in some larger-scale, pi-inspired activities.
Where Pi Day began
If you want to go where the day is said to be invented, look no further than San Francisco's Exploratorium. Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, began the tradition in 1988. Last year was Pi Day's 25th anniversary there.
Pi Day began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff. Now it's a public pi extravaganza featuring a Pi procession, whose attendees get a number -- 0 to 9 -- and line up in the order of pi's digits: 3.14159265... you get the idea.
The parade ends at the pi shrine -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year.
For those who ca n't attend in person, the Exploratorium has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes irrational exhibits, fireworks, cheerleaders, music, and dancing. The museum also lists a bunch of educational activities to teach about the concept of pi.
On Pi Day, is piunder attack ?
Where Einstein lived
On the opposite coast, the leafy university town where Albert Einstein spent the last 22 years of his life is showing community-wide exuberance for pi.
Princeton, New Jersey, kicks off Pi Day weekend on Thursday night with a reading by physicist Charles Adler, then heads into a full day of activities on Friday, including a walking tour of Einstein's neighborhood and a pizza pie-making contest.
The pie-eating contest takes place at McCaffrey's supermarket, while an Einstein look-alike competition will match mustaches and wild gray hair at the Princeton Public Library.
Pi fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show off and compete at the library, where the winner among 7 - to 13-year-olds can take home a cool pi-hundred -LRB- That is, $314.15 -RRB-. The Historical Society of Princeton will have an Einstein birthday party. Tetsuya Miyamoto, inventor of the KENKEN puzzle, will speak at the library as well.
Here are 10,000 digits of pi for you to memorize
The brainiac town residents love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are, said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009. A lot of them get super into it. Last year about 9,000 people participated, she said.
Along with her fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a town-wide Pi Day after she heard that the Princeton University mathematics department celebrates March 14 with pie-eating and pi-reciting -LRB- As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006 -RRB-.
Even more pi
Chicago is getting into the pi business too. Lots of restaurants and bakeries are offering Pi Day specials. The Illinois Science Council and Fleet Feet Sports are hosting a 3.14-mile walk/run Friday night, with discounts for anyone named Albert, Alberta or Albertina. Philly.com highlights two options for satisfying your pie cravings in the City of Brotherly Love.
Bostonians can head to Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Pi Time -LRB- 3:14 p.m. -RRB- for pi-themed activities such as Throw Pie at Your Best Friend on High-Speed Camera. 
The Museum of Science in Boston has educational Pi Day events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will celebrate too.
Even the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as Dali loved the irrational numbers Pi and Phi, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art, according to the museum. If you live in the area, check out their schedule of math-inspired films and tours throughout the day.
There are plenty of online resources too, such as piday.org.
Outside of the physical classroom, Pi Day will be celebrated online through Google's virtual classroom project. David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book The Joy of Pi, is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory.
How did Pi Day become such a big thing ?
Blatner says that Pi Day has become a hit for the same reason the new Cosmos TV show is getting so much attention.
 People all around the world are hungry to make science and math fun and interesting, he said in an e-mail. We know math and science is important, we know that it's fascinating, but we often do n't know how to make it fun and interesting. Pi Day gives us a great excuse to throw away our fear of math and say Hey, it IS kind of neat !
If you agree, just wait until 3/14/15 -- or as one popular Facebook group calls it, The Only Pi Day of Our Lives. 
That's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415, and we 're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection.
So get ready next year to take a picture of your digital clock on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. That 'll be worth more than a thousand digits.

"A school bus transporting Maxwell High School students overturned on the corner of Seally Street and Wilten Avenue. The driver of the bus was trying to avoid hitting a car that passed a red light, and the bus overturned with 37 students inside. The driver suffered minor injuries to the face, and two students broke their arms.
 
Roger Peterson, Principal of Maxwell High School, said that the driver was not at fault. His reaction helped prevent any serious injuries. As soon as the bus overturned, the driver opened the door using the emergency handle and started evacuating the students one by one. He notified the police of the students that were injured.
""We teach our drivers to ensure the safety of the students first,"" Peterson said. The driver, whose name is not being released at the moment due to an investigation, along with the two students are being treated at Belmont Hospital. The parents were notified as soon as possible by school officials.
According to John Pineda, who witnessed the accident, the school bus almost hit the car. ""The bus wasn't going that fast, but the other car was. If the bus had hit the car, those people inside would surely have been seriously injured, or worse,"" Pineda said. Pineda also said that the driver of the school bus took precaution to turn where people weren't walking. If he were to have made a right, rather than a left, he would have definitely hit people that were crossing the street.
Peterson issued a statement saying that the students who were inside the bus could miss school the next day to make sure they were okay, and relax with their family. According to Peterson, the police provided him with a list of students that were involved in the accident. Police are looking for the driver of the car that passed the red light. It was a white Honda Civic.","B1"

"One of the world's greatest tragedies was the sinking of the luxury liner Titanic. Although it was a British ship, many Americans were on board during that terrible night of April 15, 1912. The ship was on its maiden voyage on that night when it struck an iceberg in the deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The ship was in route to New York City from Southampton, UK when it hit the iceberg, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers. The ship was the largest ship ever built to that date, and was thought to be unsinkable.
 
The ship's passengers varied from some of the richest people in the world at the time, to thousands of immigrant workers who were trying to find work in the United States. The Titanic was equipped with technological safety features like remote control watertight doors, and watertight compartments, but it did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Because of the immense size of the ship, it was thought to be unsinkable, a fact that contributed to the small number of lifeboats carried on the ship. Additionally, many of the lifeboats were not filled to capacity when they were launched, causing more loss of life.
Most of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required ""women and children first,"" when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it went under. It remains more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic has been documented in film and literature over the years.","B1"
"With the rollout of HealthCare.gov -- the portal for enrollment in the new Obamacare health care exchanges -- getting hammered by critics and users, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for an exclusive interview.
Here are Gupta's takeaways from the interview:
1. Full speed ahead
I was surprised to learn just how extensive the concerns were before the October 1 rollout. Congressional investigators claim that just weeks before the planned rollout, more than two-thirds of insurers had concerns about the system being viable by October 1. Just days before the launch, the website crashed while being tested with just a few hundred people logging in, according to the Washington Post.
Despite all that, the White House decided to move forward. When I pressed Sebelius on this point, she said, We moved forward because millions of people have been waiting for health care insurance, and they did n't want to delay any longer.
Sebelius on the spot over Obamacare rollout
She made that point a few times: A few weeks wo n't make that much of a difference given that open enrollment lasts until the end of March, and that millions more people could have health insurance by that time.
2. Obama did n't know ?
According to Sebelius, President Barack Obama was not aware of any significant problems until a couple days after the website had been launched.
The Affordable Care Act is touted as a signature achievement for the Obama administration, and it surprised me that the President was not being kept up to speed -- according to Sebelius -- on the concerns around the rollout.
Sebelius: Obamacare website rollout problems blindsided President
3. A-Team late to arrive
Sebelius said in order to get the website running smoothly, she has asked that contractors bring in their best and brightest, their A-Team. I was surprised that the A-Team had n't been assembled earlier, given the magnitude of the ACA, and the challenge of setting up the website.
When I pressed the Secretary on this point, she just said that she wants new eyes and ears, and to put all hands on deck, working toward a solution as quickly as possible.
4. Open to delaying fines ?
Sebelius did not back down on the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine.
I asked how it was possible that people could face a fine, if they had tried to sign up and were unsuccessful. At that point, it seems she might have left the window open to a delay, saying only: I do n't think that that really is the question right now. 
 The issue is will people be able to sign up for affordable health care in the six-month open enrollment period ? And I think the answer is absolutely yes. 
Whether or not this issue comes up again is unclear. For now, the Secretary said the individual mandate is here to stay.
Administration to kick off effort to encourage enrollment
5. Falling on her sword ?
Finally, I asked her about the calls for her resignation. Over the past few days, her friend, Sen. Pat Roberts, as well as 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, have raised the possibility.
While not giving a decisive no, Sebelius again reinforced the mission of this task, saying it was the most important job she has ever had. She also reinforced that she served at the pleasure of the President.

"Many American basketball fans would argue that Michael Jordan is by far the greatest player ever to play in the National Basketball Association. The professional basketball league has existed since 1947, and there have been many individual players that have excelled in the game. Players such as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Jerry West had made their mark in the league long before Jordan ever played the game.
 
To be sure, Jordan had a great impact on the game primarily during his playing years with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the team to six championship finals, winning all six during the 1990s. His legend is firmly cemented into the history of the great city, and many fans feel he has no equal. It is hard to argue against Jordan in light of his success in all the titles he achieved, but basketball is a team sport, and winning a championship needs a team effort. There have been countless superstars who played in the league that did not have good teammates, and never won a title. Chamberlain falls into that category.
Chamberlain did win two NBA titles in his career, but no one in the game ever dominated it the way he did. He holds several league records, one of which is that he is the only player ever to score 100 points in a single game. However, when Chamberlain played the game, the NBA was not as big as it was in the 90s. During the 90s, the league enjoyed a much greater popularity among American viewers, and much of this can be attributed to the greatness of Michael Jordan. Jordan brought a style of play that had rarely been seen in the NBA. He garnered many individual awards during his career. He played his last few seasons as a member of the Washington Bullets.","B1"
"Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, increased competition and an appreciating yen for a 95 percent drop in third-quarter profits, as the company announced its results Thursday.
Customers check Sony's Bravia brand LCD TVs at an electronics shop in Tokyo, Japan.
Profits for the quarter, which ended December 31, fell from nearly 200 billion yen -LRB- $2.2 billion -RRB- in 2007 to about 10 billion yen -LRB- $110 million -RRB- in 2008.
Across the company, sales were down 25 percent, but electronics and games sales were especially hard hit.
Sales of games, including the company's popular PlayStation series, fell 32 percent over the year. Sales of electronics decreased by nearly 30 percent.
The appreciation of the yen also cut into profits.
A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive or forces companies to lower their profit margins to keep prices the same.
Last week, Sony warned that it will close out the fiscal year, which ends March 31, with an operating loss of 260 billion yen -LRB- $2.9 billion -RRB-, its first in 14 years. Watch what lies ahead for Sony

"Karla had just moved to the city and enrolled her eight-year-old son Gavin in a new school. Karla used to be a very active participant in the school community. She always volunteered in the classroom, went to Parent-Teacher Association meetings, and chaperone on class trips. Karla wanted to do the same thing at the new school her son was attending. She felt it was a good example for Gavin, and it helped her be more in tune with whatever was going on at the school.
 
The new school, however, had different rules. Karla couldn't just show up in the classroom and offer to help. She couldn't even offer to chaperone on class trips. District regulations required her to be fingerprinted. The school district would then run a background check on Karla based on the fingerprints. The school district had very strict rules about allowing people with criminal convictions to volunteer in the school.
While it didn't cost Karla anything to get fingerprinted, the fingerprinting office had very limited hours. She also couldn't just walk in when it was convenient for her. She had to make an appointment. The fingerprinting office was also located very far from where Karla lived. She would have to take two buses to get there.
Karla also had to get a tuberculosis test. The TB test was easy. It was just a little prick on her lower arm but this required another separate appointment at a separate location. The test didn't cost Karla anything, but again, the office where she had to go was far.
Karla understood that the school district wants children to be safe and healthy, but she also felt they were making it hard for parents.","B1"
"The Beatles are an English group of musicians from Liverpool, England. It took America by storm with their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show on primetime television. The group's first appearance was seen by more than 73 million viewers in February, 1964, introducing the band to the American people. In the months to follow, the group became the biggest Rock ‘N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.
 
The group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.
The Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music. Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other country in the world.
There was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance. Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics, and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the ""Mop Tops"" because of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing was going to stop the Beatles though. Their music is as popular today as it was 50 plus years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards presented a special telecast celebrating the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.","B1"
"Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair.
Isaac Mizrahi has earned four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
 I always start with color when I 'm designing things. Always. If the color is right, I feel better, he touts on his Web site.
But Mizrahi has an explanation for his less than colorful attire on a recent visit to CNN Center in Atlanta.
 We have this very quick trip, and we have to go right back and there's no time to pack and we ca n't check luggage... so I focused it to black, gray and white. 
It's just one more style tip you can pick up from Mizrahi's new book How to Have Style -LRB- Gotham -RRB-. Despite the slightly audacious title, Mizrahi, who has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has earned the right to tell women how to dress.
For five years, the New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target. But with his new book comes a new job -- as the creative director of Liz Claiborne.
CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK. The following is an edited version of that interview:
CNN: You started in acting at the High School of the Performing Arts. How do you combine that love and your love for design ?
Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater. I think that fashion is a form of entertainment. And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.
Like women say, Oh, that's a brand name I associate with because I 've worn it before. I love it. It seems to fulfill who I am really easily. Whatever it is, she knows that it just makes her life really easy so she associates with it, you know ? And in the end, I am like this personality that represents that. Watch Mizrahi talk about his new book 
But more than that, I have designs -LSB- in -RSB- the entertainment business. There's a movie called Unzipped about me that was a really successful movie. I had two TV series. I design costumes constantly for theater and ballet and opera. So to me it's all one big world. It's seamless to me.
CNN: What's your daily schedule like ? It has to be crazy with all that you do.
Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that. There's a base to it. I wake up, I go swimming every day, and I eat the same breakfast almost every single day. But when I get to work is when it changes up.
Some days I work in the showroom; some days I work in the design room; some days I actually work in my own private studio, where I just do sketches and sketches and sketches. Other days I work in the TV studio taping segments and my Web show.
I do n't really love travel. I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean ? When I finally let myself enjoy it, I can enjoy traveling. But it takes a great agony for me to separate from New York City and my studios and the people that I work with.
CNN: Say you 're walking down the street. What's the most common style error that you see in people ?
Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair. I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair.
You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they 're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair. Because you know what ? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.
But I always think that women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair. It's like you should spend your most money... on your hair. You 'd think I had a chain of hair salons, but I do n't. -LSB- Laughter -RSB-.
CNN: What about in home furnishing ? You do a line for Target that's ending this year. What's the most common mistake people make there ?
Mizrahi: You know what it is with people ? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home -- they leave things around. I like to think about cabinets. I like to put things away as much as possible. It's like salt shakers on the table ? No. You put the salt shakers in a cabinet, and the table looks so much better when it's plain. You know what I mean ?
And people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that. I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers. You either have gorgeous, gorgeous flowers, or you have no flowers. Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table. That's awful, but it's true.
CNN: How has your personal style evolved over time ?
Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style. I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I do n't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork. And every once in a while I break out and do something crazy.
CNN: Can you describe your personality for me, and how it affects your style ?
Mizrahi: I do n't know. It's very hard to describe one's personality. I ca n't say about my personality, but I like to think that I 'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design.
It's kind of like here's the 360 degrees of what's going on -LSB- in -RSB- the world culturally, you know ? Socioeconomically, culturally, and here's my response to it. Here's what the clothes look like; here's what you should be wearing. And it's kind of like a wonderful edge, you 're standing, and yet there's room enough in there for your own interpretation or to move in one direction or another.
Oh ! Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic. I am very claustrophobic. I do n't like to commit to one thing necessarily, but when I do commit to it, it's whole and complete.

"﻿Introduction 
Did you know that, in the UK, there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff? It’s a fact that’s covered in a government-led review, released in May 2016, in which workers, employers and customers were asked their views on the tipping process. Off the back of it, ministers said they were keen to change rules and make sure low-paid workers get the money left for them by grateful customers. The government have announced a two-month consultation on proposals that they said would stamp out unfairness. 
Among the review’s revelations was the fact that some waiters are charged up to a 15% administration fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards. In some restaurants, the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash, if they don’t collect enough tips, to cover these fees. The government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an admin fee or any other deductions. 
The government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary, calling for the system to be made more transparent, with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy. 
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether it’s fair) and what would improve it for them. 
1. Rodri, 37, London: 'Around 50% of a waiter’s income is tips' 
Average tips: £60 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. This is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees. However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. I’ve heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc (a payment arrangement used to distribute tips). Some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. So, if you sell £1,000 worth of food, the company will take £40. This is regardless of how much you make in tips. This means that if a table has a £100 bill and doesn’t tip, the waiter has to pay £4 of their own money. This leads to a money-grabbing culture and, ironically, to bad service. If a table doesn’t tip, the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers. 
I can average around £60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over £100 and, on a poor night, it’s around £40. Around 50% of a waiter’s income is tips. All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure. America has it pretty good – everyone tips. 
2. Elle, 22, Edinburgh: 'We never know whether it’s fair' 
Average tips: £20 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... France 
I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality. My main day job is in a café where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally. My main evening job is at a restaurant where we don’t get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra £2.50 per hour (which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff). My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips. 
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped – so we don’t know whether we’re getting our fair share or not. The system seems better in France, where they don’t tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income. 
3. Ashley, 22, London: 'Tips go towards customer breakages' 
Average tips: £10-15 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... Australia 
I work in a south-east London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant. In both places, tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night. Money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers. If a member of the team gets off early, they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out just before the pub closes. 
It is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team underperforms. Equally, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they don’t get what they’ve earned. It’s really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers. The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips. I make around £20 a shift but would only be given £10-15 of that money. When I am tipped well, the tips hugely impact on my finances. Occasionally, I will earn over £50 in one night, which almost doubles my earnings for that day. However, I never get more than £30 of that money after it has been shared out. I really rely on tips because I am only paid £7 an hour. 
I’d rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and therefore didn’t have to rely on tips to make ends meet. 
4. Tom, Manchester: 'A big night of tips can help pay the rent' 
Average tips: £40 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy 
Where I used to work, floor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar. The 60% went into a tronc system, which helped boost kitchen salaries. I’m not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses. 
It’s hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around £40, £20 from card tips. It can make a massive change to your weekly finances. Sometimes, people needed a big night to be able to pay their rent. 
They have got tipping right in Italy, where people don’t add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for €19, they leave a €20 note and don’t ask for change. They respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting and the experience shows.

"An 85-year-old woman in Tennessee named Astrid became a multimillionaire overnight after winning a $500 million lottery jackpot. However, her road to richness was not all completely smooth. Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of luck. The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned -- getting organized.
 
Astrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local supermarket. The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay. This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. Had she not given Astrid her spot in the line, the lottery money would have been hers!
On the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she could not contain her excitement. She danced with joy all around her house and jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. Given that her memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around her messy house for hours to no avail. She had absolutely no recollection of where she might have stored or dropped the ticket.
Astrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled. For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of her house for the missing ticket. With only three days left, she decided to finally call her daughters for help. She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice. Figuring that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her house.
Within the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, ""I found it!"" It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. ""Oh, thank you, daughter!"" Astrid cried. ""I owe you so much!"" Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her two sisters scowled at her from the next room.","B1"
"Laura was confused. She came to the United States a year ago. She didn't understand the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day. She knew that both holidays had to do with remembering and honoring people who had fought in wars for the United States. She also knew that both days were national holidays. On both days banks, schools and the post offices were closed; on both holidays, stores offered special sales; on both holidays, people hung the American Flag, and sometimes there were even fireworks. Laura had seen on television that on both days the President of the United States made a speech and visited a cemetery laying a wreath on the grave of a soldier. Laura decided to ask the mailman Brian what the difference was. She figured he would know since he had both days off from work.
 
The next day when Brian was dropping off Laura's mail, she asked him. Brian explained that Memorial Day is usually observed on the last Monday of May. This meant that it could be on a different date every year. Memorial day is a day for remembering and honoring those in the military who died, especially if they died in a battle. Brian also told Laura that Memorial Day was also considered the unofficial start of summer. Many public beaches would open on Memorial Day. Veterans day is a day set aside to thank and honor all people who served in the United States military. Brian explained that Veterans Day is also to remember those that are still alive. Brian told Laura that the date for Veterans Day never changes. It is always held on November 11, which was the date when World War I ended in 1918.","B1"

"In her uniform of a crisp, classic white shirt, Carolina Herrera exudes the kind of elegance and easy grace that has defined her fashion label for more than 30 years.
It's a look that has been sought after by some of the world's leading ladies, from style icon Jackie Onassis to actress Renee Zellweger and comedian Tina Fey, who stepped out in a navy Herrera gown at this year's Oscars.
Herrera's rise to the top of the cutthroat world of fashion started in 1981, when she launched her flagship Carolina Herrera brand in New York.
Today, her empire encompasses the signature fashion collection, a bridal collection, fragrances and accessories. Herrera has more than 280 stores in 104 countries and all this brings in billions of dollars.
Herrera says she was more interested in horses than fashion growing up in Caracas, Venezuela, where here father was Governor. But adds that she was lucky to always be surrounded by exquisitely dressed women. Today, the women in her life include her four daughters, two of whom also work for the Carolina Herrera brand.
Here, Herrera speaks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world.
On building a business...
-LRB- Fashion is -RRB- a very difficult business, as you know, because fashion is a business. If you do n't sell, then you are not in the business.
You might be the best designer and you are so creative and new, have the most beautiful ideas, but if they all stay in your room and they do n't go out to be worn by someone, then you are not in business.
The most difficult -LRB- part -RRB- of this business is to have the right teams, because I -LRB- could not have done -RRB- everything I have done alone.
If I -LRB- did n't -RRB- have my teams behind me, I would n't be sitting here. Fashion is a collaboration with many people.

On the Herrera team...
I have a team, a fantastic president who takes care of the numbers of the company. If you ask me to take care of that side, I would be sitting there crying because I do n't know what to do. If I ask her to design clothes, she would n't know how to do -LRB- it -RRB-. But I always tell the young designers that you have to separate the creative side with the business side. You have to have somebody very capable to run the business side. Because then, you 're successful.
On style...
Style is something so different in everyone. But a style is something that you do that is totally different from the other or something that you 're wearing that is the same as the other person but it looks different on you. It's a special touch. Some people have it and some people can not.
On juggling work and family life...
We women manage to do many things at the same time. Men, no. Men do one thing at a time. I see my husband say why are you doing all these at the same time ? You 're going to do something wrong here. '
I say, No.Because women, we are able to do that. Because we have children; we have to work sometime; we run a house; we have a husband and everything works. It's a question of organizing yourself.

On the Carolina Herrera brand...
I think women in Carolina Herrera... I like them to be sophisticated and I like them to be classic with a modern twist.
You can be dressed by Carolina Herrera New York, but you can have the accessories from CH and it's like a lifestyle.
On dressing for your age and figure...
It's about finding the style for the right figure or the right age. Sometimes you see women that do n't realize that age is changing your style, and they do n't change.
What you wore when you were 15 does n't look that well when you 're 30 and certainly looks terrible when you 're older. So, you have to change with the times. It's the same thing with a fuller figure or a very thin one.
On the white blouse...
The white shirt is one of the easiest things to wear, because you can dress it up or you can wear it with jeans or you can wear it with a ball gown. I mean with a ball skirt. It's so easy.
For me it's like a security blanket. When I do n't know what to wear, I say a white blouse. You can give your own look to it.

On fashion egos...
You have to deal with the fashion egos. You know, there is a lot. It should n't be treated that seriously because fashion is only making dresses to make women look beautiful. We 're not inventing anything new.
On her inspiration...
The inspiration comes from things that you have seen all your life. Sometimes you see collections that are inspired by the '20s and the '30s and the '40s and the '50s. That means fashion is a repetition of ideas. It's the way you put it together that makes it modern...
On her managerial style...
I do n't think I like to go around shouting. I do n't believe in this. I believe that you have to treat the people who work with you like your family.
On advice for women going into fashion...
First of all you have to love it. Second you have to remember that it's not going to be easy. You have a lot of problems. You have to have perseverance. You have to do it even if it does n't work and you have to keep going. You have to be strong about it. They have to have the talent to do it, because without talent, how can you do fashion ?

"﻿On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the town’s founder, a noted Norwegian engineer and industrialist called Sam Eyde. The great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him. 
Behind him, to the south, rises the equally sheer 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, lies the small, but once mighty, town that Eyde built in the early years of the last century, to house the workers for his factories. 
Eyde harnessed the power of the 100-metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectricity in what was, at the time, the world’s biggest power plant. 
But one thing he couldn’t do was change the elevation of the sun. Deep in its east –west valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not completely dark, but it’s certainly not bright, either. 
Recently, however, Eyde’s statue has gazed out upon a sight that even he might have found startling. High on the mountain opposite, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight. 
“It’s the sun!” grins Ingrid Sparbo, disbelievingly, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people “do sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... this is so warming. Not just physically, but mentally. It’s mentally warming.” 
Two young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun. On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches, smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children beam. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it’s “awesome. Just awesome.” 
Pushing his child’s buggy, electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. “It’s a funny thing,” he says. “Not real sunlight, but very like it. Like a spotlight.” 
Heidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. “But it’s far more than I expected,” she says. “This will bring much happiness.” 
Across the road, in the Nye Tider café, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001. 
The first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil , or Sun mirror , came to him as the month of September began to fade: “Every day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy,” he says, “and, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.” By 28 September, the sun completely disappears from Rjukan’s market square. It doesn’t reappear until 12 March. 
Throughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says, “We’d look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. It’s sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun.” 
Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in so-called CSP – concentrated solar power – helicoptered in the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. “It took,” he says, “a bit longer than we’d imagined.” 
It really works. There were objectors – and plenty of them – petitions and letter-writing campaigns and a Facebook page organized against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and, above all, a waste of money. But even they now seem largely won over. 
“I was strongly against it,” admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere – on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukan’s old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing. 
“And I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs,” he says. “What will they be, who will pay them? But ... well, it does feel nice, standing here. And, really, you just have to look at the people’s faces.” 
In his office overlooking the square, Rjukan’s energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town. 
Already, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are up for the time of year and Rjukan’s shopkeepers have reported their takings following suit. A hi-tech company is interested in relocating to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted. 
“This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,” Bergsland says, and, helped by assorted government grants and a donation from a local business, the town needed to find just 1m krone – £100,000 – of the mirrors’ total 5m-krone cost. 
And, seen against the town’s 650m krone annual budget, he points out, 1m krone really wasn’t very much to pay for something that “gives us a far, far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care. And just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now it’s actually here, people love it.”

"Cameron Russell aims to open up the media landscape to divergent voices a little bit at a time. In March, she helped launch Interrupt magazine, initially a webzine, so these other perspectives can join in the media conversation. Its first issue is devoted to body image.
Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media. She has been a model for brands such as Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Benetton and has appeared in the pages of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W.
She is also known for her TEDx talk, Looks Are n't Everything, about those who win the genetic lottery and how society rewards the conventionally beautiful.
To celebrate Interrupt magazine's launch, she's inviting the public to an art lab called You Are a Genius on New York's Lower East Side through Monday. It's at 215 Bowery St.
CNN spoke recently with Russell about her new project.
CNN: How did the idea come about ?
Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while. After the amazing response to my TEDx talk, my Brooklyn-based art lab decided it was time to make this a reality. At the Big Bad Lab, we build participatory art and media platforms for causes, communities and organizations we care about. I run the magazine with Hannah Assebe and Allison Bland as well as hundreds of collaborators who provide writing, photos, editing help and moral support.
CNN: Why Interrupt ?
Russell: Statistics show that diversity in the media is pretty dismal. Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations. Ever watch a panel about immigration without any immigrants ? Abortion without any women ? Marriage rights without any LGBTQ people ? We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase. Sometimes you just need to interrupt !
CNN: What are highlights in the first issue ?
Russell: It's all about body image. We found out that about 50 % of 8-year-old girls do n't like their bodies. But it's not just girls. Many women said they could n't remember a time when they liked their bodies -- they could n't remember what that felt like.
We collaborated with Interrupt photographer Marie C. who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies. Their answers illuminated a perspective that was missing from mass-media conversations. These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well ! Instead of the usual negative views -- I 'm too fat or I do n't like my nose -- these girls appreciated the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs. It's refreshing. Their story was a huge success and got over 5,000 shares.
Then there's Teagan Widmer, a transgender woman who wrote about trying to find the right bra. Her story is not exactly something the mainstream press would cover. But when we posted her advice to our Tumblr site it became one of the most popular stories.
The lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives, we do n't just have a media that lack diversity, we actually underestimate our audiences. There are n't just a few types of experiences that matter -- there are countless.
CNN: With so many publications going digital only, what made you decide to put out a magazine ?
Russell: Our first print issue is a mock tabloid. Starting this week, it is appearing for free in nail salons, newsstands, dentist offices and other not-so-hidden places around NYC. Improving access to media means not just focusing on early adopters. We are spending our resources on building a community of collaborators who can share unique and critical views.
CNN: What's been the most interesting experience in launching Interrupt ?
Russell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab. We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity. We have two selfie walls because taking a selfie is an innate and obvious way that draws in a lot of young people. We have a You Are a Geniusbar, where people can explore online resources for social services, civic engagement, health and well-being, and creative production.
Having a physical offline space where children, teenagers and random passers-by can come in and get involved is amazing. Check them out on our Tumblr feed. Many of these people spent over an hour here, took pictures, wrote pieces for the next issue and hung out. Sometimes, great collaboration is hard to nurture online so doing so offline is the way to go. We hope to run another one this fall. Stay tuned.
CNN: How do you get the word out ?
Russell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter. Now that we 're deeper into the project, we 've cultivated many more collaborations. For example, -LRB- check out -RRB- a cool piece we did with teens at South End Technology Center in Boston. We 've found artists like Ernest English, who made a piece that is drawing the most attention in the Genius Lab.
CNN: What's the biggest difference between your webzine and say Buzzfeed ?
Russell: There are a ton of new media startups heavily focused on getting huge traffic and high growth, but that's not our central goal. We want to build something that disrupts the way we think media can be made.
Can Interrupt make an impact ?
Russell: Every time someone who is n't a media maker creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact, every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work, we improve the media landscape a little bit.
CNN: What did you want to be when you grow up ?
Russell: I always wanted to become president ! When I was a kid, I was obsessed with politics. The first long book I remember reading was -LRB- Richard -RRB- Neustadt's Presidential Power in fourth grade. But as I learned more about our democracy, I realized that who participates, who votes and who gets elected is not as simple as it seems. That got me interested in how to bring people together and ignite alternative networks of power, and that's why I started the Big Bad Lab.
CNN: Who are your heroes ?
Russell: I 'm inspired by the people I work with. At the Genius Lab, we have three incredible artists. Ernest English makes enormous participatory public art pieces. Adalky Capellan is a young woman who creates very large-scale work. When I saw her photos, I knew she was perfect to do our dream selfie wall background. And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163. She is a joy to work with, and her piece is all about love, which is great for us since one of our upcoming issues is about LGBT.
CNN: If you can give one piece of advice to young women, what would it be ?
Russell: When boys at school told me I could n't play their game, my mom told me to ask: Why, do you need a penis to play ?

"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?
British education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.
One thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9–16 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.
Those negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.","B1"
"An evacuation order was lifted Wednesday morning for more than 500 California homes on hillsides vulnerable to mudslides, authorities said.
With the sun shining over much of Los Angeles, officials told people who live in the foothill areas of La Crescenta, La Canada Flintridge and Acton that they could return to their homes at 8 a.m. PT -LRB- 11 a.m. ET -RRB-.
Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for those residents Tuesday morning as a precaution when heavy rains were predicted.
The dangerous mudslides did not develop, but this area was especially hit hard after a downpour Saturday unleashed a river of mud that damaged dozens of homes.
Several of the homes were declared uninhabitable.
A massive wildfire in the Angeles National Forest last summer burned hillsides where these homes are located.

"Improvements to Oak Hall
Introduction
This report aims to describe problems in Oak Hall of Residence and discuss possible maintenance work to solve them. The two biggest issues were discussed at a meeting on 12 May, which was attended by 165 of the 250 students who live in the building.
Issue 1: temperature in rooms
A number of students complained that the second-floor bedrooms are too hot. Concerns were raised about lack of sleep and students finding it hard to study in their rooms. Air conditioning was suggested as a possible solution.
However, there is no budget left for installing air conditioning this academic year. Also, installation can only be carried out during holidays as students cannot be present in the building while the work takes place.
Issue 2: improving wheelchair access to Oak Café
It was noted that wheelchair users can only access Oak Café from the back and not the front entrance nearer the lifts. This makes access to the café difficult for wheelchair users. The university is looking to improve its wheelchair access in general by installing ramps in key areas and work can take place during term time with no issues for staff or students.
Conclusion and recommendations
Taking the factors mentioned into account, August would be the best time for the installation of air conditioning. Until then, the university could consider supplying fans to each second-floor room so students can sleep and study comfortably.
The front of the café is recommended as an ideal place to install a wheelchair ramp. This work can take place immediately and should be a priority.","B1"
"Jenny is a fifth grader. She is considered one of the most popular girls in her class. She is very pretty, but that is not why she is considered popular. She is popular because she is known to be among the brightest in her class. She can do the most cartwheels in a row, but mostly, she has the talent to dance.
 
Last year, she entered the school's dance competition and won the first place. Her whole class was there to support her. Since that day, she has been the class attraction. This year, the school is holding another dance competition, but there has been a change in this year's competition. The competition has to be done in pairs.
Jenny's class was looking up to her with high expectations of her winning again this year. On the other hand, Jenny was unsure of this year's outcome. She wanted to enter the competition, but she had never danced with a partner before. She decided to ask some of the boys in her class to enter with her. They all said no to her because they did not know how to dance. Jenny was becoming hesitant about joining.
She finally decided to turn to one of her closest friends, Carl. Jenny and Carl had known each other since the first grade. Carl was reluctant to join at first because he also didn't know how to dance. Jenny insisted. He eventually agreed to join the competition. Jenny was happy and relieved. However, she was still worried because she knew her class was counting on her to win this year's competition.","B1"
"What does it mean to be innovative in business?
In order for a business to survive in today's world, it is important that we regularly review what we are doing and how we are doing it. By considering new ideas and new ways of doing things, and trying to innovate, we can improve on our products/services, increase sales, reduce costs and make our processes more effective and efficient. Innovation is key to increasing profits.
There are several ways a company can be innovative with their products and services. Today we will look at four of them.
1. Using the latest technology to improve your product/service
When we think of innovation, we often think of new technologies. While they might be impressive, we should not use new technologies just because they are available. It is important to consider how the technology can improve our product/service and make a difference to our customer. Companies that produce cars, toiletries, household appliances, etc. often have a large R&D department to work on making their products better.
2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is on offer
By listening to customer feedback, we can get their opinions on how we are doing and find out about what it is that they want. We also need to be aware of changes in customer demands and keep up with the times. When fast-food restaurant McDonald's realised that the market wanted healthier choices, they introduced fruit and salads, while removing the 'super-size' option from their menus.
3. Offering a new product/service to reach new customers
Your business might be doing well, but there is no growth or development and there is a risk that your competitors might take away some of your customers. Innovation sometimes means developing a new product that targets a different market. Although video games were often played by boys, in 2006, video games giant Nintendo introduced the game console Nintendo Wii, successfully targeting girls and older customers with games like Cooking Mama and Brain Training.  
4. Changing the way you provide a service
By looking at the changes to the customer's lifestyle and needs, we sometimes realise that there might be better ways to serve them. Customers who do not have a lot of time might prefer to have their food or their shopping delivered to their homes, or they might like to do their banking online rather than in an actual bank.
Not all innovation will bring success to our businesses, but it can give us the opportunity to grow and learn more about what we do and what our customers might want.","B1"

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
NASA ANNOUNCER: Two... one... booster ignition... and the final liftoff of Discovery.
CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Of course, we will have more on that for you in today's show, but we are getting off the ground in northern Africa. My name is Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now !
First Up: Unrest in Libya
AZUZ: There are roughly 6,000 Americans in Libya, and the U.S. government is trying to get them out. A ferry that was chartered to take hundreds of U.S. citizens from Libya to Malta was held up for a while yesterday. U.S. officials said everyone onboard was safe. They said the delay was because of the weather.
Meanwhile, Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, is blaming the violence in his country on young people. He says they 're taking some sort of pills and being manipulated by the al Qaeda terrorist group. But during a speech earlier this week, President Obama said what's going on in that part of the world has nothing to do with outside influences.
U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So let me be clear. The change that is taking place across the region is being driven by the people of the region. This change does n't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power. It represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life.
Political Unrest
AZUZ: Looking around that region, starting next door to Libya in Algeria. The country has lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency, and what that means is that people there have greater freedom of speech and assembly now. Moving south to Cameroon, where protesters are demanding that the country's president step down. He's been in power for nearly 30 years and is running for re-election this year. Finally, Yemen, where eight lawmakers resigned to protest violence against people who are demonstrating against the government. One of the lawmakers said, I resigned because there's been no respect by the government for human rights. 
Is This Legit ?
JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit ? The space shuttle Discovery is named after sailing ships. This one's true ! The shuttle is named after two ships that explored the world.
Final Mission
AZUZ: The space shuttle Discovery has made more trips into space than any other craft. All together, the shuttle's spent almost a full year in orbit around the Earth. Yesterday, Discovery set out on its 39th and last mission, delivering equipment to the international space station. This was Discovery's first launch, back in 1984. And these launches are n't cheap. NASA estimates that every time a shuttle takes off, it costs nearly half a billion dollars. After Discovery's current mission, there are just two launches left for the space shuttle program.
Budget Battle
AZUZ: We 've been reporting on this controversial budget bill in Wisconsin. You can check our transcript archives for details on that. Now, it was scheduled to come up for a vote yesterday, but only in the State House of Representatives. Things are not moving forward in the Wisconsin Senate. And that's because Democratic senators have left the state in an effort to try to block any vote on the bill. You can get the latest details on this situation at CNN.com.
TeachersLounge
AZUZ: Our latest TeachersLounge blog asks for your opinions about a controversial budget decision in Detroit. The city's planning to close half of its public schools. And teachers, we want to hear your thoughts on this. Enter the TeachersLounge from our home page: CNNStudentNews.com !
Shoutout
TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Bozic's world geography class at Cypress Creek High School in Houston, Texas ! Willie O'Ree was the first African-American to play in what sports league ? Was it the: A -RRB- MLB, B -RRB- NBA, C -RRB- NFL or D -RRB- NHL ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Willie O'Ree made his debut in the National Hockey League in 1958. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout !
Diversity in Hockey
AZUZ: Willie O'Ree paved the way for other African-Americans to hit the NHL ice. As we continue our commemoration of Black History Month, we 're taking a look at the diversity on the Atlanta Thrashersroster. Richelle Carey sat down with the team's four African-Americans to talk about life as a minority pro hockey player.
-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-
RICHELLE CAREY, HLN ANCHOR: I want each one of you to tell me what you like about hockey. Sell me on hockey ! Sell me !
EVANDER KANE, THRASHERS LEFT WINGER: Hockey is the fastest, most physical sport there is.
JOHNNY ODUYA, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: The teamwork, too. I would say a total package sport.
ANTHONY STEWART, THRASHERS RIGHT WINGER: I just like skating fast, ever since I was three.
DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: I guess it's just something about being on the ice that I enjoy. It's just me being out there, having fun and enjoying the people around me.
CAREY: What's the biggest misconception or false assumption that people make about you ?
BYFUGLIEN: This guy ca n't stand on skates.
ODUYA: Maybe in Atlanta, you tell people that you 're a hockey player and they do n't believe you.
CAREY: What do you think ?
ODUYA: I do n't know. Maybe basketball or baseball, I have no idea.
CAREY: Who here knew that they were going to be a professional hockey player ? Anybody here know that ?
STEWART: I knew probably when I was in grade one. We had an assignment to say what you wanted to be when you grew up. And I said, Hockey player, and she said, Pick something else. And I said, No, I 'm going to be a hockey player, and I stuck with it.
CAREY: Did anybody try to steer you to something different, because you do n't look out on the ice that often and see people of color ? Did someone say this is n't the right fit for you ?
KANE: No, I think, honestly, it was almost the opposite. My dad really instilled that drive in me to battle through that kind of stuff, battle through adversity, and that's what made me so successful.
CAREY: Anybody else feel that they were steered in a different direction for racial reasons at all ?
STEWART: I grew up sort of in an urban neighborhood and, you know, a lot of my friends are playing basketball and sports like that. I 'd go play a little bit of basketball, but after an hour I 'd get bored of it, so I 'd say, I have to go play hockey now. And they would go, Uh, naw, you 're not going to make it in hockey, so you might as well play basketball or something like that. But I had some support from my parents. That helped me a lot. All my close friends to date were minor hockey players, and their support helped get me to where I am today.
CAREY: We always hear about hockey as, it's an expensive sport for kids who want to play. And often, maybe, that's why minority kids do n't get into it. Explain, why is it so expensive ?
STEWART: I think when you have to pay $500 for a pair of skates as opposed to a $20 basketball or $50 pair of soccer shoes, it makes a lot more sense to play those sports. But there's a lot of community initiatives right now in the NHL helping urban kids. And with the Hockey Is For Everyone program that's helping not so fortunate kids play, they 're making good strides.

"One of the finest Hollywood directors in the history of the film industry is Steven Allan Spielberg. Spielberg has directed some of the most significant and popular films in recent Hollywood history. His list of films reads like a who's who in the movie industry. He has directed such blockbusters as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan.
 
Born into a Jewish family on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the young Spielberg showed an interest in filmmaking during his teen years. When he was 12 years old, Spielberg created a nine-minute film to earn his photography badge in the Boy Scouts. This was the first film he made. His parents divorced when he was 13, and Spielberg moved with his family to California. After graduating from high school, he applied to the University of Southern California (USC) to learn filmmaking, but did not graduate. Instead he attended Long Beach State, where he earned his degree in Film Production and Electronic Arts, 35 years after first attending college.
His early work was as a television writer, having written scripts for popular shows such as Night Gallery, Marcus Welby, M.D., and Columbo in the 70s. His breakthrough film in Hollywood was 1975's Jaws, which is one of the most popular, highest-grossing blockbuster in the history of the Silver Screen. He followed the success of Jaws with several films that have earned him a spot in Hollywood lore. His films have become household names.
Spielberg shows no signs of slowing down. He is involved in several film projects as a director, and a producer. Spielberg has been married twice, and has six children. He was voted Forbes Magazine's Most Influential Celebrity in America in 2014. His personal wealth is estimated to be more than $3 billion.

"Guide to Digital Games and Learning
How can games unlock a rich world of learning? This is the big question at the heart of the growing ‘games and learning’
movement that’s gaining momentum in education. The Guide to Digital Games and Learning explains key ideas in
game-based learning, pedagogy, implementation, and assessment. This guide makes sense of the available research,
and provides suggestions for practical use.
The Guide to Digital Games and Learning started as a series of blog posts
written by Jordan Shapiro with support from the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at
Sesame Workshop and the Games and Learning Publishing Council. We’ve
brought together what we felt would be the most relevant highlights of Jordan’s
posts. We wanted to create a dynamic, in-depth guide that answers many of the
most pressing questions that educators, parents, and life-long learners have
raised – questions around using digital games for learning. While we had
educators in mind when developing this guide, any lifelong learner can use it to
develop a sense of how to navigate the games space in an informed and
meaningful way.
We urge you to read it. Start with the introduction that provides an overview of games in the classroom. Then go straight to
the second section which presents the way in which the research around digital games is evolving and talks about how
pediatricians, academics, educators, and researchers are working to find answers to how games and technology affect
learners of all ages. The third section, on ‘How to Start Using Digital Games for Learning’, provides examples of how some
educators are using digital games in the classroom and how they find support when running into difficulties. The next
section, ‘How to Choose a Digital Learning Game’, gives you a starting point for game selection by providing an
understanding of the types of games available in the marketplace and how to go about selecting them. Ideas about how to
overcome obstacles for using digital games in the classroom are presented in the next section and, finally, the last section
takes an in-depth look at how some teachers are using games in the classroom and their real-life struggles and victories.","B1"

They blew hot air. They blew hot air everywhere. He turned off the fans. He turned on the air conditioner. He closed all the windows. He closed the front door. The apartment began to cool down.

"Julie was sitting in bed late at night playing with her brand-new smartphone. Earlier that week, she had been visited by her children and grandchildren to celebrate her 70th birthday, and had received the phone as a gift from her granddaughter Mary. Julie had been widowed for five years now. Since she lived hours away from the rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in touch and take up some of her time.
 
Up until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel youthful, and she decided to join Facebook since that was what she had noticed all the younger people were doing. However, when making her profile page, she was embarrassed to put up a picture of herself since she thought she looked much too wrinkly and nobody would want to talk to her. To remedy this, she downloaded a picture of a beautiful 20-something year old from Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.
The next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in hopes that she would have one or two new friends. She could not believe her eyes. Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her. Julie decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. The next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and remarked, ""I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!"" Mary was confused and asked, ""Why?"" Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic.","B1"
"Whether you're travelling to the islands or the mountains of Thailand, you're likely to spend at least one night in its capital city on the way. Bangkok might be noisy and polluted but it's also an exciting city with plenty of things to see and do. Why not make it a longer stay?
Where to stay
The Khao San Road was a famous traveller spot even before Leonardo di Caprio's character in the film The Beach stayed there. But it's noisy, not very pretty and not very Thai. For something more authentic, Phra Kanong offers an alternative place to stay, with its fantastic street markets where everyday Bangkok people eat, work and live. It's not as convenient for the main tourist sites, but it has a Skytrain station so you can be at the Grand Palace in 20 minutes.
How to get around
Bangkok's traffic can be a nightmare. Sure, you can easily take a taxi – if you want to spend hours stuck in traffic jams – but there are two much better ways to get around the city. To explore the temples and historical sites, catch an express boat river taxi or a longtail boat along the Chao Phraya river and the canals. For the modern part of the city, the Skytrain is a fast, cheap way to travel from the river to the shopping malls and nightlife of Sukhumvit, and the famous Chatuchak street market.
Where to eat
The simple answer is: everywhere! Thai street food is among the best in the world, and for around $5 you can eat a filling and delicious meal. Some food stands have little plastic seats where you can sit and eat and they cook the same dish over and over, like fried chicken on rice or Pad Thai noodles. Head for Chinatown – Yaowarat Street – and choose whatever looks most interesting from the many excellent Chinese and Thai restaurants and food stands.  
What to do
After you've seen the main sites like the Giant Buddha at the temple of Wat Pho and the spectacular Grand Palace, and shopped at Chatuchak market, check out the snake farm and watch the live snake show. You can even touch a snake yourself if you want to!","B1"
"Text A:
I am not a very sporty person. There aren’t too many sports that I like doing. I have tried playing
tennis in a club but I was so bad at it that nobody wanted to play with me. So I gave it up. Ball games
are not my world. There is one activity, however, which I really enjoy, and that is cycling. Every day
when I get home from work I take my bike from the garage and off I go. I usually cycle for about an
hour except when it rains. I avoid the busy streets of my town and I especially enjoy cycling along
forest paths. As for my diet, I am not a very healthy eater and I must admit that I eat a very big
dinner every evening.
Text B:
I work in an office and sit in front of the computer all day. Life for clerical workers has become
very unhealthy lately because of the lack of physical activity. So last month I decided to change my
way of life. It was easier said than done. As a first step, I used my lunchtime to go for short walks. I
find this really enjoyable even when it rains. It’s amazing how fast you can eat lunch if you want to
have some extra time for something else. Then, two weeks ago I joined a gym. The first time was a
nightmare but gradually it became easier and I hope I can manage to go at least twice a week in the
future. If I can keep this schedule, I think I’ve done a lot for my health.
Text C:
I have always enjoyed keeping active from a very young age. I participated in different sporting
events at school such as volleyball, basketball and athletics events. At university I won several
running races as a member of the athletics club, so running has become my favourite activity.
Today I not only go jogging regularly but I started training for the marathon. I get some help from
a professional trainer because I need a training schedule that I can follow. This takes up a lot of my
time so I don’t go out much. Also I have to watch my diet if I want to be successful at the marathon.
Some people may think that this is very tiring but I enjoy every minute of it. In fact I enjoy all sorts
of exercise but I am not a fan of swimming.
Text D:
My attitude to sports is strange. At least that’s what my friends say. I am only physically active
during the summer. In winter I prefer sitting in a warm room reading a book or watching television.
I watch a lot of sports, like tennis or skiing, but I don’t do anything to keep fit. However, when
winter is over and the weather becomes warmer I wake up from my winter sleep and become really
active. I am mad about water sports. I am a member of a rowing club and also a sailing club and I
play water polo in a team. I have a small sailing boat and I spend my holidays sailing on the sea.
I know people find it funny that someone who loves water so much doesn’t do any swimming in
winter, but the swimming pool is not for me. I prefer natural water. ","B1"
"The hockey team Los Angeles Kings won the 2014 Stanley Cup, and had a parade last Monday in Los Angeles to celebrate the victory. During the parade, fans from all over California came out to support and celebrate with their favorite hockey team. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, over 200 uniformed officers were sent to the parade to make sure everything went okay. Although the parade went by without a problem, the LAPD's Public Information Officer said that there was an increase in alcohol related arrests than when the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012.
 
According to Christopher Harris, who attended the parade with his family, a lot of people who attended the parade had gone to the bars surrounding the Staples Center, and had gotten drunk before attending the parade. ""I saw one person throw up on the street in front of a policeman. They put him in the back of the police car,"" Harris said. The cheers from the crowd started getting louder and louder as the players from the Kings started passing by.
Robert Lopez, who attended the parade even though he was rooting for the New York Rangers, said that the Kings fans started getting really annoying. He was pretty sure it was because of the alcohol; everyone seemed pretty drunk. Lopez said that he was glad that he didn't bring his New York Rangers jersey, as he originally planned on, because he said people would have definitely thrown stuff at him.
A public relations worker for Los Angeles Kings issued a statement for the hockey organization saying that they do not condone people to drink before going to attend the parade. He went on to say that they took the precaution of having the parade start earlier than it did in 2012 so that people didn't have a chance to go get a drink. It seems as if it still failed.","B1"
"Public schools are available for kids from kindergarten through 12th grade free of charge. However, many families choose to pay for their children's primary and secondary education by sending them to private schools. There are many different types of private schools and many different reasons why parents send their kids there. Some private schools are military type and yet others are boarding schools where students live on campus. Some private schools are affiliated with a certain religion. These schools teach a specific faith's beliefs and traditions as well as the regular academic subjects. There are schools run by Catholics, Protestants, Jewish people, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians. There are also private schools that specialize in teaching disabled students.
 
Some parents choose private schools because they feel that they offer a better education than public schools; others choose private schools because they offer a different type of curriculum. Waldorf Schools, for example, only let children play and use items made of natural materials.
Private schools are also called independent schools or non-state schools because they are not run by local, state, or national governments. They can pick what students to go to their schools. They do this through admission examinations and interviews. There is often an admissions application. Some private schools accept anyone who can pay tuition to send their children there. Some schools charge up to $45,000 a year. Private schools charge tuition because they do not get any money collected from local, state, and national taxes. Some private schools offer a limited number of scholarships to help pay for school. Many of these scholarships are need-based, meaning for students who can't afford the tuition. Other scholarships are offered for students with very good grades or for students that have a talent in a sport or art.","B1"
"When Christopher Lee was a young man, he had a dream to become an English professor. He worked hard at this by first going to a community college after high school before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA, Chris earned his bachelor's degree in English, but he still needed his Master's degree to teach at college. Chris met George while taking a class at his old community college. George was a news reporter, who told Chris how much he enjoyed his job. Chris became very interested in his story.
 
It turned out George was also an English major, but he turned to journalism because he wanted to be published. George said to Chris one day, ""Chris, I've known lots of English majors who want to be published, but never got that chance. In journalism, you can get published, and get published often."" Chris thought about his words and asked him how he became a journalist. George laughed and said, ""Start with Journalism 101.""
Chris took his advice, and soon he fell in love with writing in journalism style. Its short, precise method of writing appealed to Chris. Journalists deal only in facts. It is not like English writing. You don't paint pictures in journalism; you report facts. There is a measure of creativity involved with writing in a journalistic style, but it is unlike English.
Soon, Chris earned his certificate, and went on to earn his Master's degree in journalism. He now works for a large, daily newspaper. He is very grateful to his old friend George, who introduced him to journalism. He has now been published more than 200 times. George changed the course of Christopher's life.","B1"
"Chicago is known as the ""Windy City"". Some people think this is because of the breeze that blows almost constantly. The city is located in the state of Illinois on the shore of one of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan, which is the fifth largest freshwater body in the world. Chicago may also be called the windy city because of the wind tunnel effect created in downtown by many tall buildings.
 
Skyscrapers are an important part of Chicago's history. The first skyscraper in the U.S. was built in the city in 1884. At only 10 stories, it was impressive for its time. The skycraper was eventually demolished. Chicago is the home of other famous firsts. It was the birthplace of the refrigerated rail car, mail-order catalogs, the car radio, the TV remote control, the first Ferris wheel, the first steel rail road, the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere. Chicago is also the home to the first blood bank and the first drive-in bank. It is also the home to The Lincoln Park Zoo, the oldest public zoo in the U.S. Maybe the windy city should be called the city of firsts.
Chicago is the third most populous city in the U.S., after New York City and Los Angeles. A little more than two and a half million people live in the city that has more than 100 neighborhoods. President Barack Obama used to live in Chicago.
Nearly 40 million people visit Chicago every year. Many of them visit the Willis Tower. Formally known as the Sears Tower, it is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. It takes only a minute to get up to the 103rd floor Skydeck thanks to some of the fastest elevators in the world. From the Skydeck visitors can see four states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.","B1"
"Nowadays many people are social media fanatics. They are always looking at their mobile phones or tablets, and updating their Twitter or Facebook accounts. They are taking pictures of what they eat, or taking pictures of themselves, which is called ""selfies"". When people are not oversharing, they are constantly reading or looking at what friends and family members are posting. Social media is becoming addicting.
 
Research shows that most people spend on average almost 4 hours a day on social networking sites. That's almost 30 hours a week. While some people need and use social media for work or to stay in touch with friends, other people find that using social media so much causes anxiety and stress. People also tend to use social media as a way to procrastinate. So just as many religions ask people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a certain time, many people are taking social media fasts. They are not updating their statuses, and they are also not reading what other people are posting. They choose to stay away from social media for 30 days.
Ironically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the Internet. The reasons people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with their families or friends by disconnecting from their cell phones. Some people want to be more productive at work. What did some fasters do instead of logging on? Some decided to connect with friends by actually sitting down and having face-to-face conversations. If friends or loved ones were far away, they would call them on the telephone instead. Some even wrote handwritten postcards or letters. The results were mixed. Some people felt that not using social media made them more anxious. Others developed more positive habits like journaling or meditating.","B1"
"Beyonce Knowles is an American singer, songwriter, and performer, who was born in Houston, Texas in 1981. She is one of the biggest female stars on the American music scene today. Knowles began her singing career in her hometown of Houston as a child. She was encouraged by her parents to cultivate her musical talents, and her parents are still a big part of her life. Her father serves as her personal manager, while her mother designs many of the costumes she wears on her concert tours, and in her music videos.
 
She first found fame as a member of the R&B group Destiny's Child, which was one of the most popular girl groups in the history of American music. Beyonce began her solo career during her time with Destiny's Child. After their break-up in 2005, the artist went completely solo. She found instant success in the music industry because of her unbridled enthusiasm for her work. She is a tireless worker, and a talented musician. Knowles is also one of the most beautiful women in the music industry.
Beyonce won her first award at the age of seven while in elementary school. By the age of eight, Beyonce, along with two childhood friends, auditioned for an all-girls group. The group won the competition, and was featured on ""Star Search"", a popular, American talent search show of the time. Although the group did not win the Star Search competition, Beyonce and the original members of Destiny's Child had their start.
Some of Beyonce's biggest hits were Deja Vu, Irreplaceable, and Beautiful Liar. She has won many awards, including nine American Music Awards, 16 BET Awards, and 18 Billboard Music Awards. In all, Beyonce has won more than 262 awards, and has been nominated for 361.

"Food trucks used to be somewhere fast to get meals for office workers in cities across the United States. The food used to be just average, certainly nothing to boast about. Food trucks were a matter of convenience, and usually offered inexpensive meals. At lunchtime in cities across the United States, workers lined up to order a sandwich and a canned soda. The meal rarely cost more than five dollars. They took their food and ate as they walked. Some workers would take their food back to their offices and eat in the company lunchroom or at their desks.
 
Food trucks have come a long way. They are no longer thought of as just fast food on wheels. Now food trucks are considered a gourmet dining experience. There are food trucks selling cuisine from all over the world. There are Korean barbecue food trucks and food trucks that sell lobster rolls. There are even food trucks that specialize in desserts. These dessert food trucks sell more than just ice-cream cones. They sell cakes and pies. There're even cupcake trucks.
Food trucks have become so popular that many use social media to reach customers and create a fan base. Some food trucks use Twitter to let customers know what their menu for the day. Other food trucks use Facebook to let customers know on what corner they will be parked.
These clean food trucks, with their gourmet food and large fan base, are not a bargain anymore though. Rarely can you get a meal from a food truck for less than ten dollars. Some people think the price is worth the quality. Others just bring sandwiches from home.

"Driving in the U.S. can be confusing not just because of all the rules and laws that drivers must follow, but also because of driving customs. Many people in the U.S. are really dependent on their cars to get to work and school. In fact most American workers spend an hour driving to work each day. In order to drive in the U.S., you have to go to your local Department of Motor Vehicles first, and take a written test to get your learner's permit. If you pass this test, you can practice driving so you can pass a road test and get your license. The Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV has free booklets you can go and get to study for your learner's permit. You can also access the information online and even take a practice written exam. To prepare for the road test, you can have a friend teach you to drive or pay to take classes at a driving school. You cannot, however, practice driving by yourself. If you are caught driving with only a learner's permit, you can get into trouble with the law.
 
Once you get your driver's license in one state, you can use it to drive in all of the United States. Wherever you drive, you will see signs posted along the road indicating the speed limit. These numbers are not a suggestion. Generally you can drive faster on a highway than on local streets. Local police use special equipment to detect your speed. If they detect you are speeding or driving over the speed limit, police can stop you and give you a ticket. You will have to pay a fine, and some of the fines are more than $100. The lines painted on the road are not just to keep cars in their lanes. They send a message. For example, a double solid yellow line means that it is against the law to pass another car here.to pass another car here.

"There are many traditions that U.S. brides and grooms are expected to follow at their wedding. One of the most well-known traditions is for a bride to toss her bridal bouquet to the unmarried female guests attending her reception. According to the tradition, the single woman who catches the bouquet will be the next woman to be married. The flowers thrown may not be actually the same flowers the bride carries down the aisle during the wedding ceremony. An identical bouquet is created for the bride to toss. This is because many times the bride wants to keep her original bouquet as a remembrance. Many women take the flower toss very seriously. There have been videos documenting how women will sometimes even fight each other for the bridal bouquet.
 
The groom has something to toss at the wedding reception, too. One tradition is the groom takes a garter from his new wife's leg and toss the garter to the unmarried men attending the reception. According to the tradition, the single man who catches the garter will be the next man to get married. Sometimes the groom will remove the garter from his wife's leg with his teeth. At some wedding receptions, the man who catches the garter has to place it on the leg of the woman who catches the bridal bouquet. Some people think this is too sexual, and just skip this part. It is the decision of the bride and groom.
The bride and groom often toast each other with champagne before the end of the reception. Sometimes a bride and groom will leave the reception before it is over. They go right to the airport to begin their honeymoon, a special vacation celebrating their new life together.","B1"
"A bridal shower is a party when a woman who is about to get married is ""showered"" with gifts and well wishes. A bride-to-be will often register at one or several department stores and create a list of things she would like people to give her as presents. This makes it easy for guests of both the bridal shower and the wedding itself to know what kind of things the bride wants. A registry also makes sure that there are no duplicate presents. A bride may want a blender, but she sure doesn't want to receive three and have to deal with the hassle of returning extras. Most bridal shower gifts are items that a newly married couple needs to start their life together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans, and even appliances like toasters and microwave ovens. Many brides also look forward to receiving some money. Cash or checks are considered appropriate gifts for a bridal shower. The money comes in handy to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring tasteless gifts like lingerie to bridal showers. Some people think those gifts are good because they help the new couple ""spice up"" their married life. Others find these types of presents embarrassing.
 
While many bridal showers are surprises, others are planned with input from the bride-to-be. A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home. It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall. Sometimes snacks and desserts are served or a full meal can be offered. Traditionally bridal showers were women only affairs. However, more and more showers are no co-ed, with men and women. Traditionally men are not invited to bridal showers but now more showers include men and the groom-to-be. Like many parties in the U.S., there would be no dancing at the bridal shower, just eating and people chatting. Some bridal showers even have games.","B1"
"Health insurance is one way to pay for health care. Health care includes visits to the doctor, prescription medication, and emergency services. People can pay for medicine and doctor visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of health insurance. At some jobs, companies offer health insurance plans as part of a benefits package. Individuals can also buy health insurance. The elderly, and disabled can get government-run health insurance through programs like Medicaid and Medicare. There are many different health insurance companies or plans. Each health plan has a set of doctors they work with. Once a person picks a plan, they pay a premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person picks a doctor they want to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary care provider.
 
Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans have health insurance by 2014. Those that do not get health insurance by the end of the year will have to pay a fine in the form of an extra tax when they file their income taxes. Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, privately, or through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state marketplaces, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and health care needs. These marketplaces also create an easy way to compare what different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they may qualify for government programs that offer free health insurance like Medicaid, Medicare or for children, a special program called the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).","B1"
"The chart shows the sales revenue of a selection of home video entertainment formats in the USA in 2017. It also shows the percentage change from the previous year.
Online video streaming was the most popular format in 2017. US consumers spent $9.8 billion on services such as Netflix, which was a rise of 32 per cent from the previous year. For the average American, this accounted for nearly half of their spending on video entertainment at home.
At the same time, customers were moving away from the three physical formats in the chart. DVD and Blu-ray sales dropped by 14 per cent over the twelve-month period to $4.5 billion in 2017, and rent-by-post revenues went down by 20 per cent to $0.5 billion. DVD rental shops saw the largest decline, as spending fell by 21 per cent to just $0.4 billion.
Overall, there was a clear downward trend in spending on physical video formats, as they all showed relatively low sales and they were all in decline. However, there was an upward trend in paying for streaming.

A Coast Guard team has stopped the source of the spill, the agency said in a news release.
The river is closed from mile marker 425 to 441.
No one was injured in the accident, which happened at 1:30 a.m..
The Mississippi River at Vicksburg moves about 890,000 cubic feet of water per second, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. If the vessel were to lose all its oil, that would be about 11,000 cubic feet.
In February 2012 a tanker barge spilled 10,000 gallons of oil into the Mississippi after a collision near New Orleans. The Coast Guard drained the barge and towed it to a repair facility.

"Once you find an apartment you want to rent, you need to contact the landlord, the person who owns the property. Most landlords are not individuals anymore, but rather are companies that own a number of properties. You and the landlord will set a date to view the place you are interested in renting.
 
On that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some landlords will require you to fill out an application. The application will ask questions about your job, salary, and how many people are going to live with you in the apartment. The landlord wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay rent on time. Some landlords will even ask for references, the names and telephone numbers of people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most landlords will also run a credit check. A credit check is your history of paying bills on time. If your potential landlord sees that you owe a lot of money to different companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If you have bad credit or an unstable work history, you may be required to get a co-signer, that is another financially responsible adult to sign the lease, a rental contract, with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.
If you cannot afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in someone's home. The process to rent a room is like renting an apartment except you only have a room and usually have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. Most apartments and rooms in the U.S. are unfurnished. You are expected to bring your own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa, and anything else you need.","B1"

"-LSB- Breaking news alert, 6:23 a.m. GMT -LRB- 01:23 a.m. ET -RRB- -RSB-
Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- along with England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- following a historic referendum vote. A majority of voters rejected the possibility of Scotland breaking away and becoming an independent nation.
With 31 of 32 councils declared, the No campaign has won the referendum on Scottish independence.
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond admitted defeat in Scotland's independence referendum Friday -- and urged the rest of Scotland to do the same.
In a televised statement, he thanked Scotland for 1.6 million votes for Scottish independence. A turnout of 86 % is one of the highest in the democratic world for any such vote, he said.
-LSB- Original story published at 12.37 p.m. ET -RSB-
Voters in Scotland made their choice Thursday -- remain part of the United Kingdom, or form their own independent nation. They chose to remain.
With 31 of 32 of councils reporting, the No campaign had garnered enough votes to secure their victory, and with it Scotland's continued place within the union.
The first councils to declare all went to the No campaign, as did the capital, Edinburgh, which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the union with 123,927 for Yes and 194,628 No votes. Argyll and Bute and Aberdeenshire also voted No. 
Glasgow delivered a solid win for the independence camp with 194,779 votes for Yes, and 169,347 for No, but lead was not big enough to overturn the No camp's overall majority so far, which maintains a 8 % -LRB- 54 % to 46 % -RRB- lead over pro-independence camp.
The majority of the early results have been going the anti-independence camp's way. The No campaign extended lead with Angus and East Dunbartonshire council results, alongside a landslide in Dumfries and Galloway. The oil-rich city of Aberdeen also strongly voted for the unionist camp.
The city of Dundee was the first big gain for the independence campaign, voting Yes with 53,620 votes for, 39,880 against.
The individual counts by local authorities are ultimately immaterial as it is the total number of votes countrywide that will determine the outcome.
Polls at more than 5,500 stations across all districts, from the remote highlands and islands to the big cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, closed at 10 p.m. local time -LRB- 5 p.m. ET -RRB-. People still in line to vote at that time were allowed to cast ballots.
High turnout
The first districts to report turnout reported high participation -- well over 80 % in most cases -- Mary Pitcaithly, chief counting officer, announced in Edinburgh.
Turnout in Glasgow, one of the Yes campaign's heartlands, was a relatively disappointing 75 %.
More than 4.2 million people registered to vote on the question: Should Scotland be an independent country ? 
A vote for independence would mean Scotland, with its population of about 5.3 million, splits from the rest of the United Kingdom, made up of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in addition to Scotland.
 The people of Scotland have engaged in this conversation, Phil MacHugh, a spokesman for the Yes camp, told CNN on Thursday night. They have really gone out there, found out the information that they wanted to know, and made that choice today. 
Prime minister's address
British Prime Minister David Cameron will make an address Friday morning. The content will depend on the outcome of the vote, but in the event that Scottish voters decide to stay in the union, Downing Street says he will refer to plans for further redistribution of powers from the central government to the Scottish Parliament, signed by Westminster leaders earlier this week.
The counting officer for Edinburgh, Sue Bruce, explained just after 10 p.m. that each ballot will be double-checked, to verify each voter's decision.
Addressing dozens of election workers, Bruce added, I look forward to working with you during the course of the evening to deliver an accurate and transparent Edinburgh count in which you and the voters of Edinburgh can have full confidence. 
Voting was brisk at one polling station in Glasgow as the polls opened Thursday, with many people voting on the way to work or before taking their children to school.
Bad weather or the sheer volume of votes cast could slow down the counting process. However, the weather forecast appears good so far -- important when some ballot boxes must be collected by helicopter, plane or boat from polling stations on distant islands.
Allegations of voting fraud were reported by Glasgow City Council, with several instances of people turning up at voting booths in Scotland's largest city to vote, only to be told that they had already voted.
The Council stressed that there was never actually a situation of double voting and the affected ballots are now being searched for and taken away.
Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who has led the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, cast his ballot Thursday morning in the village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire.
Labour lawmaker Alistair Darling, who has headed the pro-union Better Together campaign -- backed by the main parties in Westminster -- voted in Edinburgh, while former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, another pro-union campaigner, voted in the town of Kirkcaldy.
For the first time, the vote was extended to 16 - and 17-year olds living in Scotland. Nearly 110,000 people younger than 18 have registered to vote.
Voters in the referendum did not have to be British citizens; Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens who live in Scotland and are registered to vote there can cast a ballot. However, Scots living outside Scotland do not have a say.
Nearly 790,000 people applied for a postal vote -- the largest volume of registration for postal votes ever in Scotland.
After the polls closed, Salmond tweeted, This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future truly is in Scotland's hands.

"﻿An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank, slithering down a 50-metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea. 
In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo, Inky – a common New Zealand octopus – made his dash for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar. Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium. 
Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: “Octopuses are famous escape artists. I don’t think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what’s happening on the outside. That’s just his personality.” 
One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor – a journey of three or four metres – and then, sensing freedom was at hand, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawke’s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island. 
Another possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. “When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,” said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. “The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and he’s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.” 
Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken. “I understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well,” he said. “I have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?” 
Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins. They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington, an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs, then returning to its own. Another at the centre, Ozymandias, was thought to have broken a world record for opening a jar before it was released into the ocean. 
Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot. He was scarred and “rough looking”, with shortened limbs, said Yarrell. “He had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasn’t in the best shape.” According to Yarrell, Inky – who is about the size of a rugby ball – was an “unusually intelligent” octopus. “He was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here. We have another octopus, Blotchy, but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.” 
The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a “one- off” but the staff are “increasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do”. Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might be willing to take it on. “You never know,” said Yarrell. “There’s always a chance Inky could come home to us.”

"Kit Skogsbergh can see it now.
 He would be a sidekick, she told me. He would have a soft and soothing voice.... He would kind of be like Piglet in the Pooh movies because he would be a little cautious and scared of things, but once he knew the plan and how things worked he would warm up to it and maybe by the end of the movie he might not have to roll up into a ball -LRB- and hide -RRB-. He 'd be able to face things head on. 
The 32-year-old from Pasadena, California, recently filed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to make an animated character out of a pangolin, a little-known, scale-covered mammal that's notoriously shy and, to Kit's point, can protect itself from pretty much anything in the wild -- lions, tigers -- by rolling up into a ball.
The pangolin is being trafficked toward extinction -- sold for its scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for its meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. Pangolins are traded by the ton.
Disney could give the pangolin the celebrity it needs to survive.
I 'd encourage you to sign Kit's petition at Change.org.
If people cared about the pangolin the way they care about tigers or elephants, it easily could be saved from extinction. The trouble: Few seem to realize these awesomely introverted animals exist. They 're little studied and barely understood. They 're also not conventionally cute, which makes it easier for conservation organizations and the public to write them off as expendable. Yet they are essential, valuable creatures.
I recently went to Vietnam and Indonesia as part of CNN's Change the List project to document the massive illegal trade in endangered pangolin species. I had n't heard of pangolins before readers voted for me to cover the illegal animal trade as part of that project; and Kit had n't heard of them until she read the story last week.
 I got about halfway through -LRB- the story -RRB- and my stomach hurt so bad I could n't finish it, Kit told me last week. I had this nagging feeling, you know, to do something about it. 
Kit's petition -- titled Help beautiful and mysterious pangolins by featuring them in an animated movie ! -- had 1,425 signatures as of Monday morning. At least 13 other readers also started petitions urging Disney to put a pangolin character in an animated film or short, according to Pulin Modi, a senior campaigner at Change.org.
Disney and Disney Pixar have the reach to make the pangolin popular. And they do n't have to do it out of the goodness of their hearts. It could be a hit. Pangolins are the ultimate underdog -- lovable and secretive, curious and little-known.
Mother pangolins carry their babies around on their backs; pangolins hang from trees by their tails; and their tongues are longer than their bodies.
Plus, Disney already has a choice of names. CNN readers are voting on a name for pangolin P26, which was rescued from the wildlife trade and was recently released back into the wild in Vietnam. Some of the names would be perfect for an animated character: Pemalu, which is Indonesian for shy ; Bao, Vietnamese for protection. Or Percival, which is alliterative and fun.
 When you introduce a character in a Disney film the animal suddenly gets more recognition and people start talking about it, said Kit, who is a Disney fan.
 That education and awareness is what's going to help shape future generationsminds. Maybe we can start with younger people and they can grow up not wanting to eat the pangolin. 
It might seem far-fetched that any Disney viewer would eat pangolin. But not for Kit, who is Chinese-American and who told me her father likely has consumed endangered wildlife products while doing business in China, possibly including pangolin.
It's been a source of family conflict.
 It's like talking to a piece of cheese, you just do n't get anywhere, she said of her conversations with her dad about the welfare of endangered animals. It's funny to him that people are concerned about what happens to an animal -- because it's just an animal, it's nothing more than that. It does n't offer anything more than food or nourishment or medicinal properties. He laughs and says it makes you live longer or it makes your skin nice. And he 'll say, You 're crazy ! You Americans !
She does n't think she 'll be able to persuade her dad to change, but younger generations may be the ones to save animals like pangolins and rhinos, she said.
And Disney could reach them.
Kit's own story is proof it could work.
Kit was born in the United States, and she developed a fondness for animals when she was young. Her parents valued animals for their function -- Doom the Doberman's ability to protect their home, their duckseggs -- but she saw them as friends.
 Maybe I did n't have enough friends and the animals were always super friendly all the time, she said. I feel like it's pretty easy to make friends with animals. She now has three cats -- Cheezburger, Monster and Ninja -- and a rabbit named Bunny.
She became an advocate for animals because she got to know them.
 As a Chinese-American, I also want to speak up because the demand in China is helping drive the demand for pangolins to be killed for meat and medicines, she writes in the Change.org petition. I can tell you many Chinese citizens do not support this cruelty, and I believe we can bring wildlife advocates from around the world together to ask Disney to take this simple, fun, positive step to help pangolins. 
 It did n't cost me anything but half an hour of my time, she said of the petition.
And it would take far less time to sign it.

"One of the most well-respected actors in Hollywood today is Tom Hanks. He is one of the most popular actors among American film, and television viewers. He has gained great success as a film actor, having starred in some of the greatest movies of his generation. He starred in films such as Splash, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, and Big.
 
Born in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks began his career in television in the popular TV show Bosom Buddies, where he plays a man living in a women's dormitory. In order to live among the women, he and his roommate must dress in women's clothing during the evening hours after arriving from work. This series ran for three years and made Hanks a legitimate star.
Hanks reached film stardom in Splash, which was a very popular love story involving Hanks as a frustrated bachelor, and a mermaid. The movie launched his film career that featured Hanks in mostly comedic roles. Hanks would probably always be known as a comedic actor if he did not star in his share of dramatic roles. He played a former baseball star in A League of their Own, and a romantic lead in the popular Sleepless in Seattle. In 1993, Hanks won an Academy Award for his portrayal as a displaced worker who gets fired from his job because he contracts AIDS in the film Philadelphia. He lost 35 lbs. for his role as the gay lawyer because he wanted to look sickly. Hanks followed his Oscar-winning performance in Philadelphia with a second Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Forrest Gump. He became only the second actor to win the award in consecutive years.
Tom Hanks has used his celebrity status to address several causes such as same-sex marriage, environmental issues, and the development of alternative fuels.","B2"
"Carl Sagan was possibly the most famous American astronomer ever. He was an astronomer, scientist, author, cosmologist, and television host. His landmark show ""Cosmos"" was one of the first science shows to gain acceptance by the general public in the United States. Sagan challenged Americans to think about their place in the universe like no other person before him. Using the scientific method, Sagan challenged long-held beliefs about the genesis of life on earth. This he has done to the enlightened scientific community, and to the anger of the religious community. Many of Sagan's teachings contradict the creationist belief of the beginning of life. He was also interested in the search for life beyond the planet earth, and participated in the only human message sent into space intended for an alien race.
 
Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1934. His interest in science began at an early age. He wrote and co-wrote 20 books, and had more than 600 scientific research papers published. His most popular work was ""Contact"", which tells the story of first contact with an intelligent alien species. The book was made into a movie in 1997 starring Jodie Foster. The book and movie angered many religious groups because of its message that human beings are not alone in the universe.
Sagan earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from the University of Chicago in the 1950s. His scientific curiosity led him into developing the television series ""Cosmos"". It was one of the most watched science series, and has been recreated and is currently on the air. His work on the Galileo project lives on today. The spacecraft is speeding its way through infinite space today with his message of greeting to whatever race of beings finds it. Sagan died at the age of 62 from complications resulting from pneumonia.

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- I 'm Candida Moss and I am professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. I was an adviser on the True Cross episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in CNN's Finding Jesus series, which currently airs on Sundays.
Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the Finding Jesus Facebook page during the show. Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them. My apologies to everyone I did n't get to. Feel free to tweet your questions to me directly.
Herb Scribner: Can anyone explain to me what the Bible's deal is with 40 days/nights ?
Moss: It's more an interest in the number 40. In the Hebrew Bible the people of Israel wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they reach the Holy Land. The flood lasts for 40 days and nights; Moses spends 40 days and nights on the mountain; Goliath spends 40 days encouraging the Israelites to challenge him before David steps up; 40 is a common age for people to be when they get married; in the book of Judges it is always 40 years between judges; and David and Solomon each reigned for 40 years. What we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full, complete period of time. It's sort of like a narrative stock number, in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three.
Yalanda M. Price: Was there any division between the followers of Jesus and the followers of John the Baptist ?
Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John does n't lay down his tools and follow Jesus after he baptizes him. Nor, it seems, did John's disciples. They had separate ministries and, while there may have been contact between the two groups, they were also de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace. There are some hints in the New Testament that Jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from John by stating that Jesusbaptism was better -LRB- Acts 11:6 -RRB- and countering the idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead -LRB- Matthew 14:2 -RRB- Some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of Jesus and followers of John.
Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin.
Jeffery Graff: Can the DNA tests on the bones indicate whether he is a Jew or even whether he is of the tribe of Levi ?
Moss: I 'm so glad someone brought up DNA. The DNA tests on the Bulgarian bones yielded only mitochondrial DNA -LRB- DNA passed down by the mother -RRB-, not the more reliable nuclear DNA -LRB- the kind of DNA referred to in forensic investigations -RRB-. In the original study of the Bulgarian relics -LRB- of which I was a part -RRB- the mitochondrial DNA revealed that the Bulgarian relics were of probable Semitic origin. Thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the Copenhagen scientists, I recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 %. The episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a Middle-Eastern man.
As for the more specific question about the genetics of Jews and members of the tribe of Levi: Current scientific technology does not reveal this kind of information even if start-up genetic testing companies promise this kind of information.
Cyndi Rosenthal: Are there any other historical references of John the Baptist outside of the Bible ?
Daniel José Camacho: Any extra-biblical sources that shed light on historical figure of John the Baptist ?
Moss: -LRB- These questions are on a similar topic, so I 've chosen to answer them together. -RRB- Actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of John the Baptist. This is important because it's fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers. The Jewish historian Josephus mentions John the Baptist in his book, The Jewish Antiquities. Josephus describes John as a good man who possessed virtue and had great influence over the people. According to Josephus, Herod put John the Baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion. This gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why John was executed and provides further evidence about just how important John was in his own day.
Watch the latest full episode anytime on CNNgo
Daniel José Camacho: Wait, how did Jesus get Our Father prayer from Johnny B ??? Did n't catch that.
Moss: I 'm also really glad someone brought this up, because I wondered about it too. In the Gospel of Luke, one of Jesusdisciples says, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. It's an interesting request that tells us something about John the Baptist's ministry and the demanding characters of Jesusdisciples ! In Luke, Jesus responds to this request by teaching them the Lord's Prayer. We do n't know that the Lord's Prayer came from John, and personally I do n't think it did; I think this is just how Luke shaped his version of events. But if you were just reading Luke you could come to that conclusion.

"Stepping on the London subway train five years ago, the thirtysomething marketing manager never imagined her morning commute might eventually lead to the Paralympic Games. Now, that's exactly where Britain's Martine Wright is setting her sights.
Wright lost both legs when a suicide bomber blew himself up on a subway train near London's Aldgate station on the morning of July 7, 2005. She also suffered a fractured skull and severe arm injuries.
Though she was one of the most seriously hurt that day, Wright is now aiming for a spot on the British Paralympic volleyball team in 2012.
 I would love, absolutely love, to be part of the Paralympics in 2012, Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month. I mean, if you had said that to me five years ago, I would have thought that you were absolutely mad. But to go back to London, where I was born, and to do something so positive -- after I left on such a negative -- would be absolutely amazing. 
Four bombs were set off that day in July, on three subway trains and a bus. Fifty-six people were killed, including the four bombers, and more than 770 were wounded.
The bombings happened the day after the International Olympic Committee announced London would be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012.
Wright said she made a promise to herself and her family after the attacks to grab every single opportunity that she could.
 I think I 've done more now than what I did before, she told ITN. I 've learned to fly planes, and I 've jumped out of a plane, learned to ski again. 
She competed for -- and won -- a place on Britain's sitting volleyball squad. The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
Some 640 athletes from 20 countries are taking part in the event, the biggest major international competition before London 2012, according to Lisa Wainwright, chief executive of Volleyball England, the sport's national governing body.
John Bestebroer, the head coach of the women's team, calls the championships a great training opportunity for 2012. 
Sitting volleyball is a version of the sport that allows anyone to participate, including those with a disability. The men's event has been part of the Paralympics since 1980 and the women's since 2004, according to British Volleyball.
International volleyball rules apply in the sitting version, with certain amendments for disabled players: During play, a player must touch the court with some body part between the buttocks and the shoulders, and players are allowed to block serves. Also, sitting volleyball is played on a smaller court with a lower net.
Wright told London's Evening Standard that the 2012 Games will have an added poignancy because her last real memory before the bombings was celebrating with colleagues when London was chosen to host the Olympics.
She was the last person pulled from the station that day, and Wright said she feels she's one of the lucky ones.
 Even on your darkest days, there will always be someone that's worse than you are, unfortunately, Wright told ITN. There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me, 'cause I 'm still here.

"Former F1 champion Michael Schumacher has been discharged from a Swiss hospital and is returning to his home, where he 'll continue his recovery from head injuries suffered in a skiing accident last year, his spokeswoman said Tuesday.
 Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months, said Sabine Kehm.
 There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead. 
Schumacher, 45, sustained severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29.
His investigative team said it thinks the experienced skier hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while traversing an area between two marked pistes, which catapulted him face-first onto another rock.
He was treated first at a hospital in Grenoble, in France, and then in June moved to a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, near the Schumacher family home.
Kehm appealed, as she has previously, for the privacy of his family to be respected as Schumacher continues his recovery.
The German national is a seven-time world champion whose F1 racing career ended in 2012.

"Richard Milhous Nixon was the 37th president of the United States, and the only one to resign from office in the history of the country. Born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, Nixon was a Republican Party member who served as vice president under President Dwight David Eisenhower in the 1950s. Nixon ran for president for the first time in 1960, losing to the very charismatic and young Democrat, John F. Kennedy. The 1960 election was one of the closest elections in history. Kennedy went on to become one of the most popular presidents ever.
 
Despite his loss to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon bounced back in the 1968 election when he defeated Democrat, Hubert Humphrey in a landslide victory. The country was in turmoil during the 60s. The conflict in Vietnam was raging, the country was reeling from the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, and his brother Senator Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Nixon's victory indicated the country was ready for a conservative leadership during these tough times.
Nixon won the 1972 election over Democrat George McGovern in another landslide victory, which seemed to establish Nixon's legacy as a great president. Among his accomplishments was to open trade with China, and his promise to end the conflict in Vietnam. However, Nixon would end up resigning from office just a year after his victory.
It was discovered that the Republican Party, with Nixon's knowledge, had secretly recorded the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. during the weeks leading up to the election. Nixon tried to cover up the scandal, but the pressure was too great. Nixon was forced to resign in disgrace rather than be impeached from office, which means to be removed from office by the U.S. Congress.

"Hugh Hefner is one of the most controversial public figures in the United States. He is the founder, and president of Playboy magazine, which is a men's adult magazine. From humble beginnings in the 1950s, Hefner has grown his pornographic industry into the multi-million-dollar enterprise, which includes his magazine publication, TV, and Internet media.
 
Born in Chicago, Illinois in 1926, Hefner led an average life growing up in the big city. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and majored in psychology. After serving two years in the United States Military, he began working as a copy editor at Esquire magazine in the early 50s. Hefner quit his job to go out on his own. He was determined to start a magazine that was similar to Esquire, a men's magazine. His first ""Playboy"" was published from his home in 1953, without a publication date. He did this because he was uncertain if there would be a second edition.
Hefner had purchased a nude picture of the famous actress, Marilyn Monroe, and used that image as the centerfold of his first issue. The 50,000 copies sold quickly, and Hefner became an instant success story. During the 60s, Hefner and Playboy were at the top of their popularity. His circulation was now in the millions, and Hefner ventured into new areas for his company. He produced films, started modeling agencies, built hotels and resorts, and hosted two television series. His publication was not without controversy, though.
In 1963, he was arrested and stood trial for publishing a photo of American actress, Jayne Mansfield. The charges were eventually dropped, but it was clear that there would be challenges to his publication because of its content. Hefner permanently moved his headquarters to Los Angeles in 1975 so that he could be closer to the film industry. He has been married three times, and has four children.","B2"
"﻿In Canada’s Arctic, summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than 20 hours a day. For some, it’s a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter. But, for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset. 
“I haven’t fainted once,” said 29-year-old Abdul Karim, one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011. This year, that means eating at about 1.30am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets. “The only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health,” Karim said. Pointing to his sizable frame, he laughed as he added: “But, looking at my condition, I don’t think fasting will hurt me.” 
As the end of Ramadan draws near for Muslims around the world, much of the holy month’s focus on community work, prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world. But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic, the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached. 
Most in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa, some 1,300 miles south of the city – following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city. It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015. “It’s long days, but more manageable.” 
Many in the 100-strong community break their fast together, gathering in the city’s brand new mosque – completed in February amid temperatures that dropped as low as -50C with wind chill – for nightly suppers. As they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries, the sun shines brightly through the windows. 
It’s a scene that plays out across Canada’s northernmost mosques during Ramadan, as Muslim communities wrestle with the country’s unique geography. The 300 or so Muslims in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, have several options when it comes to fasting during Ramadan, said Nazim Awan, president of the Yellowknife Islamic Centre, with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill. “There might be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours, but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina.” In recent years, much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton, in Alberta. Some, such as Awan – a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting – follow the timings of Mecca. He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton. 
“If I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times, my son might say, 'Papa, you are really insane. What are you doing?'” he said. Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun, the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik, a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, have also been following Edmonton’s timetable. “We currently have 24 hours a day of sun,” said Ahmad Alkhalaf. “There’s no sunrise or sunset.” 
The adherence to Edmonton’s schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people. “My first Ramadan here was in December. There’s no sun at that time; it’s dark all day and night. So we used Edmonton time.” At times, it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, Alkhalaf said. “You’re supposed to break your fast when it’s dusk and we eat when the sun is out. It’s not usual to have iftar [the meal breaking the fast] when the sun is up,” he said. In Inuvik, where much of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions. The iftar meal includes dates and rich curries – as well as local game such as reindeer, prepared in accordance with Islamic law. “We make a soup or curry … but instead of using beef, we use reindeer.” 
In Iqaluit, as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan, some reflect that 2016’s timing – stretching across some of the longest days of the year – has made it one of the more challenging of recent years. It’s particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset. But, his efforts will be rewarded years from now, said Karim, thanks to the lunar calendar. Ramadan will eventually fall during winter, which, in Iqaluit, sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day. “I’ll follow those hours, too,” he said with a laugh. “Oh yes, definitely.”

"Millennials in the workplace
Background
Millennials (those born between the early 1980s and the early 1990s) make up a huge part of our workforce but they seem to lack loyalty to the companies and the leaders they work for. Multinational companies are noticing larger turnover rates of millennials as employee retention rates fall. This report looks at the findings of two large-scale surveys on the mindset of the millennial generation and explores how organisations can strive to address these needs, increase employee engagement and encourage retention.  
Research
In a global survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), more than 40,000 millennial (born between 1983 and 1993) and non-millennial responses were collected on the topics of workplace culture, communication and working styles, pay structure, career development, work–life balance, etc.
In a separate global survey conducted by Deloitte, more than 10,000 millennials participated in a study about their perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work.
Key findings
Millennials are as committed to their work as their more senior colleagues.
Millennials value interesting work and a good work–life balance. They do not believe that excessive work demands are worth sacrifices in their personal lives.
Millennials want flexibility in their working hours and are willing to give up pay increases and promotions for a flexible working schedule. They believe that success should be measured by productivity and not by the number of hours they are seen in an office.
Millennials want to feel supported and appreciated by their company and their superiors.
Millennials want more opportunities to develop their skills. These include technological skills, teamwork and interpersonal skills.
Millennials believe that businesses and business leaders should contribute to the improvement of society and they are more likely to be loyal to a company with strong ethics.
Recommendations
Organisations and managers wanting to retain millennials should consider:
monitoring their workload and satisfaction levels with their work–life balance
creating a flexible work culture where employees have more control over their working hours and their work location
providing meaningful work and interesting opportunities
offering help and support in continuing professional development
changing the organisation's goals from being mainly about profit-making to motives that address social concerns and solve wider societal problems.","B2"
"Not every parent looks forward to the day when their child goes off to school. In fact some parents are not sending their students to school at all. Instead they are choosing to teach their children at home. This is called homeschooling. Parents, caregivers, or private tutors educate children individually at home instead of sending them off to be formally educated in public or private schools. In the U.S. only about three percent of children are homeschooled.
 
There are many reasons why some parents choose to homeschool. One reason is that some parents do not feel their children are safe in school because of bullying and a growing trend of police in school. Other parents want their child's education to be based on their religion or moral beliefs. Yet other parents feel like the education in school is not good enough. Homeschooling is also seen as a choice for families that live in rural areas, and families that travel, like actors.
There are many different ways to homeschool, and homeschooling allows parents to customize lessons based on their children's needs. Families can purchase textbooks to use or create their own materials. Some parents follow a philosophy called unschooling, which allows a child to determine when, and how they want to learn based on their natural curiosity. Some worry that homeschooling means students won't have opportunities to socialize. To answer this concern, some families have created cooperatives, where a group of homeschooled students will learn and play together and participate in activities that would normally happen in school like field trips and prom.
Being homeschooled doesn't mean a student cannot go to college. Most colleges accept homeschooled students. It is important, however, for parents and students to create a portfolio or proof of what has been learned.","B2"
"There can be different kinds of entertainment at a wedding reception. Usually there will be a Master of Ceremonies, or MC, who helps move the reception along by making announcements of what will happen next. For example, the MC will announce when the newly married couple enters the reception hall, and all the guests will stand up and applaud. A wedding reception usually has music and guests are expected to dance. The music can be provided by a DJ or by a live band. Sometimes the DJ or live band will accept requests from guests to play a certain song. When the newly married couple enters the reception, they will share a dance by themselves to a song they picked beforehand. Usually the song is something romantic and represents the couple's love for one another. Sometimes the bride will share a dance with her father and the groom will share a dance with his mother. After these special dances, the guests are invited to the dance floor.
 
Food at a wedding reception can be buffet style, where everyone serves himself or herself, or it can be a sit-down meal served by waiters. Guests get to choose among a meat, chicken or fish deal. Guests generally make their choices when they respond to the initial wedding invitations.
During a wedding, guests shouldn't expect to spend too much time with the bride and groom. The new couple is usually very busy greeting all of their guests. Sometimes the couple doesn't even get a chance to eat. What almost every newly married couple does get to eat at their wedding reception is the wedding cake. The bride and groom traditionally cut through the wedding cake together, and then feed the other person a bite.","B2"
"﻿An atmosphere of melancholy and changing times pervades the opening to the final series of Downton Abbey. The year is 1925 and there are already the first rumblings of the economic storms that will blight the end of the decade. The neighbours are selling up their own stately home, while Lord Grantham seeks to cut back on servants after declaring that under-butlers are no longer affordable. 
But at the real Downton Abbey, Highclere Castle – a stately home owned by George “Geordie” Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon – the financial outlook has rarely been brighter. According to Lady Fiona Carnarvon, the huge global success of Downton has funded a rolling programme of building repairs aimed at safeguarding Highclere for the next generation. 
“It’s been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,” she said. “It’s given us a wonderful marketing platform, an international profile. I’m hugely grateful. My husband and I love the house, and the people here. Now, without doubt, it is loved by millions of other people.” 
Currently, only the ground and first floors of Highclere, on the borders of Hampshire, are used. But, a restoration project of derelict tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showcasing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Sir Charles Barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842. 
When the Downton Abbey producers first approached Highclere in 2009, the family faced a near £12m repair bill, with urgent work priced at £1.8m. But, by 2012, the Downton effect had begun to take the pressure off. Lord Carnarvon said then: “It was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions. We had been doing corporate functions but it all became pretty sparse after that. Then, Downton came along and it became a major tourist attraction.” 
Visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as Downton Abbey, scripted by Julian Fellowes, came to be screened around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and, then, in the US. It is now broadcast in 250 countries. The formerly somewhat basic ticketing policy has become a computerized advance booking system, helping to guarantee foreign visitors admission. The accounts of Highclere Enterprises for 2014-15 show current assets have almost trebled to around £1m since 2012. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the series, said: “I think Downton Abbey secured Highclere’s future.” 
Peter Fincham, ITV’s director of television, recalls the moment when Highclere was booked. “I thought, 'So what?', because I had never heard of Highclere Castle. One stately home looks much the same as another. How wrong I was. The castle has been one enormous character as well.” 
The Downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. VisitBritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, include castles and historic houses on their itineraries. Almost half of potential visitors to Britain now say they want to indulge in “set jetting ”, visiting places featured in films or on TV. More than a million embark on a tour of historic buildings each year, spending in excess of £1bn. From the biggest emerging tourist markets, 51% of Brazilians, 42% of Russians and Chinese, and 35% of Indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips. VisitBritain’s director, Patricia Yates, said: “The links between tourism, films and TV are potent ones.” She added that period dramas have also raised the popularity of regions outside of London. 
Neame is now an ambassador for the GREAT Britain campaign, which is backed by government departments and the British Council, using it to promote the UK around the world. Events include special Downton -themed receptions at British embassies. 
Neame said: “They approached me because of the reach. A lot of people here think of it as soapy entertainment. In other parts of the world, people revere our actors, our writing and production talent. It is something I am passionate about; I am a really strong believer in soft power. We are not nearly as proud of our achievements as we should be. 
“Downton Abbey is iconic for expressing Britishness. Really, it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. It’s the first TV period drama that has really leapt out of the screen and become part of popular culture.” 
Lady Carnarvon is still keen to emphasize that the long-term future of Highclere is not necessarily secure. “The bottom line is quite thin,” she said. “The programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings, have the follies restored.” 
In the pipeline is a Tutankhamun centenary event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, together with Howard Carter, discovered the tomb that revolutionized our understanding of Egyptology. Another opportunity to keep Highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of Lancelot “Capability” Brown, who designed the grounds. 
“What you do is never sit on your laurels. Every single day, don’t take anything for granted,” said Lady Carnarvon. “For all these great houses, you have to invest in them. And, there has been a deficit since the 1930s. Perhaps, in the past, an estate and house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how Geordie and I seek to support and look after Highclere. 
“From my point of view, I’ve tried to persuade people it is fun and have specific events they can engage with, not just a wander around a dusty house. We have to compete with attractions like the London Dungeon.”

"Evangelical pastor Ted Haggard described Thursday as fundamentally true an assertion that he engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a 20-year-old male volunteer in 2006.
Pastor Ted Haggard acknowledged on CNN's Larry King Live that he had a second relationship with a man.
The incident occurred when the two men were in bed together, Grant Haas said in a videotaped interview played on CNN's Larry King Live. 
 He pretty much asked me if it was OK if he masturbated in front of me or masturbated in the bed next to me, Haas said. I told him no, it would make me really uncomfortable. But he grabbed a bottle of lotion and started masturbating. 
Haas added, -LRB- Haggard -RRB- used to say to me, You know what, Grant, you can become a man of God, and you can have a little bit of fun on the side. 
Haggard, 52, said the incident was an indicator of the compulsive behavior that ruled him at the time. However, he said he has been undergoing therapy during the two years since and working it out. Watch Haggard accuser speak out 
Controversy involving Haggard first erupted in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence.
Haggard initially admitted in interviews that he received a massage from Jones but denied having sex with him. He also said he bought methamphetamine, but threw it away instead of using it.
The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy, particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex. Watch Haggard address allegations on Oprah 
Haggard is the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which claims to represent millions of people in 45,000 congregations nationwide. He was also the head pastor at New Life Church.
In a settlement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive counseling and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement but who was not authorized to speak on the record.
In the CNN interview, Haggard credited Jones with having helped him by disclosing that information.
 I think he rescued me. I 'm very grateful to him, Haggard said. He said he would have lost the support of his wife of 30 years, Gail, and their five children and been a drug addict had he not been caught.
 I paid a heavy price. It was stupid, he said.
Haggard likened his struggles with his desires to the struggles faced by dieters who say, I 'm not going to eat todayand then they eat. 
 Many of the charges against me are exaggerated, but it does n't matter, Haggard told Larry King. I 'm guilty enough of so many things. 
He acknowledged that his actions were hypocritical, but said he could not control his urges.
 I felt like God's plan was for sexuality to be in a monogamous, heterosexual marriage, he said. I wanted that. But at the same time, I had these other things going on. 
Haggard said he had thought that focusing on his spiritual life would help, but found that it did not. It actually made me worse, he said.
Haggard said that, for a time, he lost the ability to read the Scriptures and became suicidal. I think it was divine intervention that stopped me, he said.
Asked if he has engaged in inappropriate conduct with any other men, Haggard did not give a direct answer, saying only, I have thoroughly discussed all of my sexual history with my wife and my therapist and, to some degree, the family, and we think that's an appropriate boundary for that. 
Asked whether he considers himself bisexual or gay, Haggard said that different therapists have described him in different ways. The first said, You are a heterosexual with homosexual attachments.I was n't sure what that meant. 
His current therapist, he said, described him as a heterosexual with complications. 
Haggard said he has, at least, another year of therapy ahead of him.
 I think I 'm still deeply wounded and scarred and somewhat confused, he said. About other men, he added, I have thoughts from time to time, but not compelling thoughts. 
Nevertheless, he said, Today, I 'm 100 percent satisfied with my relationship with my wife, and I have no compelling things in my life toward others. 
He said he initially urged his wife to leave him, but she refused.
 I really do love this man, she told CNN when asked why she did not leave. But it was also her faith that led her to stick with the marriage, she said. The teaching of Jesus is that we forgive and that we love. 
She said the two had a great sexual relationship in our marriage... throughout marriage. 
Though the news of his unfaithfulness came as a shock, it was n't completely out of the blue, she said. I knew that Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts. I never knew that he acted on them. 
Marcus Haggard, the couple's 25-year-old son, said he, too, was shocked by the revelations, but was more disturbed to learn that his father had lied. Still, he said the news brought the family closer together.
 He had lived so long on a pedestal, Marcus Haggard said about his famous father. He seemed practically perfect. There was a sense of relief in the fact that we could connect with our dad. 
Asked if he wants to return to the pulpit, Haggard said, I think Gail and I both want to tell our story to the degree that it's helpful to other people. I do n't know that that would mean a pulpit, but certainly I 'd be interested in public speaking. 
His appearance Thursday coincided with the debut of an HBO documentary called The Trial of Ted Haggard.

"A flurry of small earthquakes rumbling near the Mammoth Mountain Volcano, have been categorized as volcanic unrest by the United States Geological Survey.
Nearly three dozen earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2.6 to 3.8 have swarmed the area, northeast of Fresno, California, over the last two days.
Earthquake swarms in this region are not uncommon. David Shelly, a seismologist with California Volcano Observatory, said this swarm is bigger than we 've seen recently, but normal in the area. He adds they are keeping a close eye on the movement, but in the larger scheme of things, it's within in the range of activity over the last several decades. 
Mammoth Mountain is in an area called the Long Valley Caldera. The center of the caldera has been uplifting slowly over the last several decades and seismologists continuously monitor it. We think there is fluid coming up from the crust triggering the earthquakes, said Shelly.
The last swarm of quakes from 1997 to 1998 produced over 2,500 earthquakes per week at its height, according to the USGS. Since then, the region has been relatively quiet.
In July, USGS scientists installed a volcanic-gas monitoring station on the mountain. It tracks gases that fluctuate with earthquake activity to better track the changes in real-time.
The awareness level on the USGS website remains at green/normal. Mammoth Mountain, standing at 11,053 feet, last erupted about 57,000 years ago, according to the USGS.

"Overall, the two pie charts show that smartphones and tablets are used for the same purposes but to very different extents. 
The first pie chart shows how people spend their time on smartphones while the second pie chart illustrates how time is spent on tablets. For both types of device, the top use is for games, but the figures differ greatly. 57% of the time spent on a tablet is given to playing games, while only 35% of the time spent on a smartphone is used for this. In contrast, smartphone users spend 29% of their time on their gadget accessing social networking sites compared with just 15% of tablet time spent on the same activity.
The third most popular use of the tablet is for consuming entertainment, with users spending 13% of their tablet time watching videos and listening to music. Smartphone users, however, dedicate only 8% of their smartphone time to such entertainment, preferring instead to spend 20% of their time on their phone accessing utilities. These can include maps, weather information and calculators.
There is a clear difference in the way people are using their smartphones and tablets. In general, while tablets are being used more for gaming and other forms of entertainment, smartphones seem to be the preferred option for tasks as well as communication with the world around us.","B2"
"A cardinal from the Philippines, another from Austria and an archbishop from Ireland would be the least worst choices to be the next pope, according to a group representing the victims of abuse by priests.
The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, released its list Thursday as cardinals held meetings at the Vatican in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff.
The three are Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines; Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Austria; and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin, Ireland.
Martin is not a cardinal, but SNAP noted that a man need not be a cardinal to be elected pope. Historically, the role has gone to cardinals, however.
CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, also a correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, wrote last month that Schoenborn certainly has the right pedigree for the job. 
And Tagle has been a leader in pushing the church in Asia to take an aggressive stance on clerical abuse, Allen said in a series he wrote on the papal contenders.
Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think, he said.
Wednesday, SNAP named its Dirty Dozen list of men it judged would be the worst candidates for pope because of their handling of, or comments on, past allegations of child sex abuse against clergy.
The scandal has shaken global confidence in the church in recent years.
A Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday indicates that U.S. Catholics see it as the biggest issue the Vatican faces.
Asked what they think is the most important problem, 34 % of the U.S. Catholics questioned mention sex abuse, pedophilia or some other reference to the scandal. No other problem garnered more than 10 % of the responses.
A report for Italian news magazine Panorama on Thursday claims that the church hierarchy was alerted to the problem decades ago, in 1965 but buried the warnings.
` Absolutely key '
Since Monday, the gathered cardinals have been holding meetings, known as general congregations, to discuss the most serious questions facing the church.
The last of the cardinals summoned to choose the next pope, Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man of Vietnam, arrived at the Vatican on Thursday.
No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new pope, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman.
But Cardinal Roger Mahony, the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, suggested that the announcement might not be far away in a tweet posted Thursday.
 Days of General Congregations reaching a conclusion. Setting of date for Conclave nearing. Mood of excitement prevails among Cardinals, he said.
The 115 cardinal-electors -- those under the age of 80 who are eligible to vote for the new pontiff -- are taking time to prepare for what many see as their greatest responsibility.
Although some may be wondering why it's taking so long to set the date for the conclave, Lombardi pushed back against the idea that the cardinals were dragging their feet.
The discussions they are having in the general congregations are a vital part of the process, he said, since once the conclave starts there wo n't be much time between votes for reflection or the exchange of ideas.
The cardinals have to have all the information they need in order to make a mature, responsible judgment in the election, especially at a time when the church faces complex issues, he said. The preparation is absolutely key, Lombardi said.
Celibacy for priests a hot issue, not just for church leaders
U.S. cardinals muzzled ?
Italian media reports Thursday focused on the Vatican's move to end the news briefings held this week by American cardinals, amid concerns over leaks of confidential discussions among the cardinals.
Sister Mary Ann Walsh, director of media relations for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote in a blog post that the decision Wednesday came after a media report in Italian daily La Stampa, which gave details of who had said what.
 I compared the shutdown to the old Catholic school style of one kid talks and everyone stays after school, she wrote, saying a similar thing happened before the last conclave in 2005.
 We 'll continue briefings, but without cardinals, to help U.S. media especially cover this exciting moment in the church, Walsh added.
It's been a week since Benedict XVI became the first pontiff in six centuries to resign from the role. Popes usually serve until their death.
With Easter around the corner, many inside the Catholic Church would like to see a new pontiff in place to lead ceremonies.
Watch for the smoke: How is a new pope elected ?
` Mix and mingle '
All the cardinals, including those older than 80, are entitled to take part in the closed-door general congregations.
Lombardi said 152 cardinals met Thursday morning. A second meeting will take place in the afternoon, as the cardinals seek to pick up the pace before agreeing on the date for the conclave.
Thursday morning's business included reports on the financial state of the Holy See, Lombardi said. He named the cardinals who delivered the reports but did not reveal their contents.
The cardinals could continue their meetings on Saturday, Lombardi added, but are unlikely to meet Sunday when Mass may be held.
Interactive: A look at possible papal contenders
Some of the discussions happen over coffee, as one Vatican spokesman revealed Monday, the first day of the general congregations.
 There's a coffee break for about 30 minutes at a special buffet area in the front part of the audience hall, said the Rev. Thomas Rosica. Cardinals have an opportunity to go down and mix and mingle. 
 They want to say what the next pope will hear, because he's probably in that room, and they also want to alert the people who have n't spent so much time in Rome just what the situation really is here as they see it, Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said.
The electors also want to go into the conclave with pretty clear ideas about whom to vote for, Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston said. They, too, have no interest in seeing it drag on, and there is no reason to believe that it will.
The past 11 conclaves have lasted no longer than four days, the diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, wrote on its website.
That was n't always the case. In the 13th century, the election of one pope took two years and nine months, the diocese said. Catholics grew so angry at the cardinalsindecision from 1268 to 1271, when Gregory X was elected, that they boarded them up in their chamber and tore off the roof to expose them to the elements.
The fiasco led to the creation of the conclave and its precise protocol -- partly to expedite the process.

"Johnny Carson served as host for the iconic, late-night television series The Tonight Show for 30 years. During that time, Carson entertained generations of American television viewers with his down-to-earth style, casual approach, and quick-witted humor. The Tonight Show was already a big success when Carson took over from the retiring Jack Paar, but Carson took the show to the next level. His style, and grace on camera has been mimicked by many late-night talk show hosts, who have credited Carson as their mentor.
 
Carson was born thousands of miles away from the glitz of New York, and Los Angeles, in the city of Corning, Iowa, in 1925. Carson began his entertainment career at the age of 14 when he appeared at county fairs as a magician, which was his first love. His family moved to the state of Nebraska when Carson was a young man, and he served as a communications officer for the U.S. Navy during the tail end of World War II. His broadcast career began in 1950 in Omaha, Nebraska before moving to Los Angeles, and landing a job with a local television station.
Carson officially became host of The Tonight Show on October 1, 1962. The show was based in New York City until 1972 when, at Carson's request, the show was permanently moved to the Los Angeles area. Carson hosted his show in Burbank for the next 21 years, where he perfected his style and approach to his guests. It was considered an honor to be invited to The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.
Carson was a true entertainer. He performed many skits during his reign, where he dressed up in costume, and played ridiculous characters, which is something today's late-night hosts do not do. Carson was never afraid to laugh at himself.z","B2"
"Russian space officials say the crew of the Soyuz space ship is resting after a rough ride back to Earth.
A South Korean bioengineer was one of three people on board the Soyuz capsule.
The craft carrying South Korea's first astronaut landed in northern Kazakhstan on Saturday, 260 miles -LRB- 418 kilometers -RRB- off its mark, they said.
Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said the condition of the crew -- South Korean bioengineer Yi So-yeon, American astronaut Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko -- was satisfactory, though the three had been subjected to severe G-forces during the re-entry.
Search helicopters took 25 minutes to find the capsule and determine that the crew was unharmed.
Officials said the craft followed a very steep trajectory that subjects the crew to gravitational forces of up to 10 times those on Earth.
Interfax reported that the spacecraft's landing was rough.
This is not the first time a spacecraft veered from its planned trajectory during landing.
In October, the Soyuz capsule landed 70 kilometers from the planned area because of a damaged control cable. The capsule was carrying two Russian cosmonauts and the first Malaysian astronaut. E-mail to a friend

"Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-Apartheid activist, and human rights advocate, whose life had a profound effect on American culture. Mandela served as president of South Africa from 1994 through 1999, but his story began decades earlier. His life’s work was to bring South Africa into mainstream 20th Century thinking by ending Apartheid.
 
Apartheid was a system of South African government that was based on racial segregation between the minority white population and black South Africans. It was a controversial form of government that was in effect from 1948 to 1994, and caused great social turmoil. The system was put into place following World War II, but racial segregation began much earlier in the country. Apartheid separated South Africans by race by placing people into four classifications: white, black, coloured, and Indian. Each group had different levels of privilege, with white South Africans being the most favored.
From 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million black South Africans were forcibly removed from their homes; in 1970, all non-white politicians were removed from government. Mandela’s move to end Apartheid began in 1949 when he supported, and organized non-violent boycotts, strikes, and civil disobedience. He was arrested, and charged with treason in 1956 for his role in the social uprising, and was eventually jailed for 27 years. During this time, most of the countries in the world called for his release, and placed trade embargos against the white regime.
The country finally gave in to international pressure, and released Mandela. He became an international symbol for peaceful demonstration, and for his humanitarian work and perseverance. He was elected President of South Africa in 1994, serving for six years. Mandela died in December, 2013.","B2"
"As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines wo n't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children.
Joining a handful of other carriers, United made the policy shift in late April with little fanfare.
Previously, families with small children flying coach were allowed on aircraft before general boarding, a convenience for moms and dads trying to herd their kids across the friendly skies.
 We figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups, said United spokesman Charles Hobart. The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
 I have to wonder if it will end up slowing things down because of the extra time it takes for families to board, said Brett Snyder of the blog crankyflier.com.
Kate Hanni of flyersrights.org calls the move very anti-family. 
 There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days, but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane, said Hanni in an e-mail to CNN. I hope United changes their mind. 
 If families do need additional assistance, our gate agent will work to accommodate them, Hobart said. That message has been communicated. 
 We 're not going to fly United knowing that we 're going to have to put up with that extra hassle, wrote Steven Manson, a Brooklyn, New York, father of twin 4-year-old boys. Frankly, we always look forward to the preboarding when we fly and try and position ourselves near the gate when boarding begins. It's just so helpful getting the car seat attached and everyone settled before the plane is crowded with passengers, Manson said in an e-mail to CNN.
A guerrilla approach to flying with kids
The policy change also has roots in the merger announced in 2010 between United and Continental.
 We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft, Hobart said.
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding. However, the airline said it makes an announcement to all ticketed passengers before general boarding asking anyone who needs extra time or assistance to come forward.
 It would not be realistic to preboard that many families just on that sole basis alone, wrote an American Airlines spokeswoman in an e-mail to CNN. It could easily translate into most of the passengers for the flight. 
JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said. Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets. So does Virgin America, which said it allows children under 5 to board early.
US Airways tweaked its child preboarding rules within the past year -- allowing families with kids to get on the plane after the call for Zone 2, but before the general boarding announcement. Previously the airline had allowed earlier boarding. We 're always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and quicker for our passengers, said spokeswoman Liz Landau.

"Johnny Depp is an American film star known for taking eccentric roles that many Hollywood stars would not. He has won two awards for best actor, including a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actor's Guild Award. Depp has played some of the most endearing characters in modern American film history, making him one of the most popular actors in America today.
 
Depp was born in Kentucky, but raised in Florida. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 to pursue a career as a Rock 'n' Roll musician. He gained very little success as a musician, and was introduced to acting by his former wife while they were visiting Los Angeles.
After debuting in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Depp got his first break when he was cast in the popular TV show 21 Jump Street. The show ran for several years, and Depp began getting noticed by Hollywood producers. His first huge hit was playing an artificial character in the film Edward Scissorhands. This role was the first of many odd characters played by Depp. Edward Scissorhands was critically acclaimed, and won several industry awards.
Depp followed his success in Edward Scissorhands with a series of strong roles. In 1999, he played Ichabod Crane in the movie Sleepy Hollow. His performance was well received by critics, and audiences alike. His most successful role was playing Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, another eccentric character. This role was described as a difficult one that only someone like Depp could pull off.
In 2005, Depp starred in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, playing once again a very eccentric character that lived in a chocolate factory.","B2"
"﻿The continual relegation of women to the sidelines of football was given a good kicking when France appointed its first female professional team manager. It did not matter that it was a second-division club. It did not matter if it was, as some bad sports – male, of course – suggested, just a cynical stunt to drum up publicity for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63, currently ranking a lowly 14th out of 20 in its league. 
What mattered was that Helena Costa had been given the top job, a move that saw her make football history by becoming the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional European league. “As a woman, it’s made me happy,” Véronique Soulier, president of the club’s supporters’ association, told journalists. “When I first heard the news, I was rather surprised, but, once that passed, we were pretty unanimous that it’s good news. We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing.” 
The new manager of Clermont Foot 63, whose average home crowd at the stadium at Clermont- Ferrand in the Auvergne region of south-central France is around 3,800, is a former talent spotter for the Scottish Premiership side Celtic. Costa, 36, was born in Alhandra on the River Tagus in southeast Portugal and graduated with a master’s degree in sports science. She is also a UEFA-licensed coach. She previously coached Benfica’s male youth teams, the Qatar women’s team, which she led to its first international victory in 2012, and, more recently, the Iranian women’s national side, which she left in September 2013. 
Costa was appointed on a two-year contract by the president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude Michy, who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club. In 2013, he announced the team had signed Messi. They had. Not the Argentinian and FC Barcelona record-breaking striker Lionel Messi, but Junior Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from Cameroon. 
France’s women’s minister, Najat Vallaud- Belkacem, tweeted: “Bravo to Clermont Foot for understanding that giving women a place is the future of professional football.” 
Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only previous woman coach of a men’s professional team, said: “I don’t know Helena, but, if she has been hired by a team, then it means that she knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day, this can become normal.” Morace was an outstanding player in the women’s game. She was the top scorer for 12 seasons in Italy’s Serie A and played for Italy in 153 internationals. In 1999, she was named as the coach of Viterbese in the men’s Serie C1. But, after only two games, she resigned from the job following a clash with the club’s mercurial proprietor, Luciano Gaucci, who at the time was also the owner of a Serie A side, Perugia. 
Morace was quoted as saying that she had refused Gaucci’s demand that she fire her deputy and the side’s trainer. “He let me know that I could carry on working with whomever I wanted. But, by then, mutual trust was lacking and I didn’t fancy carrying on in that climate of uncertainty,” she said. Morace works today as a lawyer in Rome and as expert soccer commentator on television and in the pages of the daily Gazzetta dello Sport. 
She said: “For the time being, I see too many men, even in the women’s game, who are working, despite not having the same expertise as women, who, by contrast, are not working.” Raymond Domenech, former manager of the French national team, said: “Women know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it. Why shouldn’t they manage men’s teams? The opposite happens and doesn’t cause any problems. It’s a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. I say well done to President Michy. I told myself that, if I took charge of a club again, I’d hire a woman as my number two. He beat me to it.” 
A statement on Clermont Foot 63’s website said Costa’s appointment would allow the club to enter “a new era”. On the club supporters’ website, reaction to Costa’s appointment was a mix of surprise and a certain cynicism. “In my opinion, it’s just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she won’t last the season. I find it hard to believe she’ll be able to get the players’ respect, above all when she’s the same age as the oldest,” wrote one fan. “Her CV isn’t bad, but now the question is: will she be good enough?” added another. A third wrote: “I wish her welcome and success but I think it’ll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business. Has our president pulled off a media coup?” 
But Soulier was hopeful: “Hopefully, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation they’re lacking at the moment,” she said. “The boys in the team can be difficult to manage. With a woman in charge, maybe they’ll be less demanding.” 
If Costa’s reputation is anything to go by, she will be the one making the demands. After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot José Mourinho’s first stint as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, she was reportedly described as “Mourinho in a skirt”. Costa quickly kicked the sexist remark into touch. “Like Mourinho, I always want to win. As far as that’s concerned, yes, I’m happy to be compared with him,” she said.  ","B2"
"In June, Diane visited her friends who live in San Francisco, California. This was Diane’s first time in the city, and she enjoyed her opportunities to walk around and explore.
On the first day of her trip, Diane visited the Golden Gate Bridge. This red suspension bridge measures 1.7 miles in length. Diane and her friends did not walk across the bridge. However, they viewed it from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which offers hiking trails, picnicking areas, and presents spectacular views of the bridge and city. Diane and her friends made sure to take a group photograph here, featuring the bridge in the background.
The next day, Diane and her friends visited Alcatraz Island. This island is located 1.25 miles offshore in the San Francisco Bay. It used to serve as a lighthouse, military fort, and prison. Diane and her friends took a small tour boat across bay to reach the island. Their visit included a guided tour through the old military base and prison. They also took a walk around the island to appreciate some of the native wildlife in addition to the views of the city.
Diane and her friends spent the final day of her vist in San Francisco’s downtown area. Diane’s favorite part of her entire trip was taking a trolley to transport her up and down the hilly streets of San Francisco. Diane did a lot of shopping downtown on her last day. She and her friends celebrated the end of her visit by having dinner at one of San Francisco’s best restaurants.","B2"
"﻿The Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in “inhumane” conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41C. 
Dancevic, who collapsed during the second set of his first-round match against France’s Benoît Paire on the uncovered court six at Melbourne Park and passed out for a minute, said conditions were plainly dangerous for the players. He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: “I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow, Snoopy – that’s weird.'” 
“I think it’s inhumane. I don’t think it’s fair to anybody – to the players, to the fans, to the sport – when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out,” he added. “I’ve played five-set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, it’s not normal. 
“Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it’s too hot to play; until somebody dies, they just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. I, personally, don’t think it’s fair and I know a lot of players don’t think it’s fair.” 
Other players were in broad agreement. The British number one, Andy Murray, said: “It’s definitely something that you have to look at a little bit. As much as it’s easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That’s not great. 
“I know when I went out to hit before the match, the conditions at 2.30–3pm were very, very tough. Whether it’s safe or not, I don’t know. There’s been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks.” 
Caroline Wozniacki said: “I put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic. So, you know it was warm.” 
John Isner, who retired from his first-round match with a right ankle injury, said: “It was like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are done. That’s what it’s like.” 
The defending champion Victoria Azarenka took the same line. “It felt pretty hot, like you’re dancing in a frying pan or something like that,” she said. 
The tournament’s “extreme heat” contingency plan was put into force for women’s matches on Tuesday, allowing an extra ten-minute break between the second and third sets. Under a change to the rules for 2014, however, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, Wayne McKewen. Rather than use the raw Celsius readings to assess the heat, organizers prefer to use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature composite, which also gauges humidity and wind to identify the perceived conditions. Organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where play would be stopped. “We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time,” McKewen said in a statement. “That didn’t happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue.” 
Dancevic, who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, resumed after medical attention but, unsurprisingly, ended up losing 7–6, 6–3, 6–4. “I was really close to stopping completely,” he said. “I wasn’t really running too much towards the end. I wasn’t tired; I just felt my body temperature was too high.” 
A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonic’s 7–6, 6–1, 4–6, 6–2 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts. China’s Peng Shuai also said the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 7–5, 4–6, 6–3 defeat to Japan’s Kurumi Nara. Officials played down health risks, saying the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention. 
“Of course, there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match,” Tim Wood, the tournament’s chief medical officer, said in a statement. 
Most competitors, though, followed Roger Federer’s line that, although conditions were tough, they were the same for both players. “It’s just a mental thing,” the Swiss said, albeit before Dancevic collapsed. “If you’ve trained hard enough your entire life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there’s no reason. If you can’t deal with it, you throw in the towel.” 
Dancevic disagreed. “I don’t think it’s much to do with the shape the players are in. Some players are used to the heat – their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others’ can’t,” he said. “It’s hazardous to be out there; it’s dangerous. It’s an hour and a half since my match and I still can’t pee.”

"David Goldman says he ca n't understand why he ca n't have custody of his son following his ex-wife's death in Brazil. The U.S. government agrees.
David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another childbirth.
Goldman told CNN's Larry King he had no idea when he dropped off his wife and 4-year-old son at Newark International Airport in 2004 for a two-week vacation to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that he was about to become embroiled in an international custody battle.
Shortly after Bruna Bianchi Goldman arrived in her homeland she called to say she wanted a divorce, which she obtained in Brazil, and would stay there with their son, Sean.
The running custody battle has taken many twists and turns and has gained the attention of the Department of State and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
 A child belongs with his family, and there is no reason why David Goldman should not get his child back, Clinton said in a recent interview on NBC's Today show. And we 're hoping that that will be resolved very soon. Obviously, if not, we will continue to raise it with the Brazilian government. 
For nearly five years, Goldman has fought to regain custody of his son. It's a case that has been complicated by Bianchi Goldman remarrying, getting pregnant and dying during childbirth last summer. Sean Goldman is said to be living with his stepfather, who has been granted provisional guardianship.
 I went down... to bring my son home, Goldman said on CNN's Larry King Live Wednesday, figuring his ex-wife's death had made the custody issue a moot point, and we find out that this man does n't file custody, but he files to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that they had issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey. 
Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government.
 The Department of State is working diligently to ensure that David and Sean Goldman are accorded their rights under the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil right aspect of International Child Abduction, the agency said in a statement. We 'll continue to insist that the Brazilian government fulfill its obligations under the treaty and international law. 
The convention, to which Brazil is a signatory, is a multilateral treaty, which seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return, according to the Hague Convention Web site.
Brazilian courts have refused to return Sean Goldman to the United States for any custody hearings that New Jersey courts have ordered and the Brazilian government has not intervened. As a result, the case remains a stalemate.
 I would tell him that he's been very brave, as he has fought to have his son returned to him, Clinton said in the NBC interview. His son is the most precious person in the world to him and he has gone not just the extra mile, but mile after mile, back and forth, trying to make it clear that his son Sean deserves to be returned to him. 
But on Larry King Live, Helvecio Ribeiro, a Bianchi family spokesman, questioned Goldman's fitness as a parent.
 I do n't question the biological right, he said. The fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent, you have to be more than just a DNA donor, Mr. King. Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you 're not there.
 And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so, Ribeiro said.
Goldman visited his son for the first time in more than four years last month -- a bittersweet experience that was heartbreaking when it was time to return to the United States.
 He asked me why I have n't come to see him in all this time, Goldman told Larry King, and that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. I did n't want to tell him that... they 're holding him. 
International custody fights are common and were supposed to be simplified by the 1980 Hague agreement, but conflicting court systems and conflicting accounts of relationships can trump international law. The next step in this case is uncertain.

"President Obama on Monday gathered together every confirmed member of his Cabinet for the first time as president and challenged them to cut $100 million in the next 90 days.
President Obama meets Monday with his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, right.
Agencies will have to report how they saved on expenses at the end of the period.
The federal government has a confidence gap when it comes to the American people, Obama said at the White House.
 We 've got to earn their trust. They 've got to feel confident that their dollars are being spent wisely. 
The edict is part of Obama's commitment to go line by line through the budget to cut spending and reform the government, a senior administration official said.
One potential Cabinet officer was missing from the meeting -- Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary-designate. The Senate has not voted on whether to confirm Sebelius to the post.
Obama made his savings request as the House of Representatives and Senate were returning from recess this week, ready to start reconciling their versions of the fiscal 2010 budget resolution. The president's budget request is $3.67 trillion. Watch how the administration hopes to cut costs 
In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a small amount, critics said.
 Any amount of savings is obviously welcome, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said. But -LSB- $100 million is -RSB- about the average amount we 'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year. 
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs insisted that ordinary Americans nevertheless would appreciate the savings effort.
 Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million not a lot of money, Gibbs said. It is where I 'm from. It is where I grew up. And I think it is for hundreds of millions of Americans. 
The administration also contends the order signaled an important demonstration of fiscal responsibility.
 None of these savings by themselves are going to solve our long-term fiscal problems, Obama said. But taken together, they can make a difference, and they send a signal that we are serious about how government operates. 
The White House offered examples of how agencies already have started cost-cutting measures, including:

"Abraham Lincoln is a name that is forever embedded into the collective conscience of every American. It is perhaps the most recognizable name in the history of the country even as his death occurred approximately 150 years ago. Lincoln presided over the country during, what is perhaps, the most divisive era in its history. Lincoln served as president for only four short years, but his impact on the country at the time, and today, has been huge.
 
During his presidency, the United States was in the middle of a terrible civil war. At the center of the split between the two sides was slavery. The north was a fast-growing, industrial region that was more progressive than their southern counterpart. The southern economy was based on cotton production that mostly used forced labor. The north viewed this practice as unethical, and immoral, while southerners claimed it was an integral part of their culture. When Lincoln won the election, the southern states began to secede from the Union, and the war began.
Lincoln vowed to end slavery during his campaign for president, while never speaking about how the country would keep its relationship with the southern states when slavery was ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with the south to review their practices. It effectively put an end to the war. Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865 by a southern sympathizer as he sat in a theater with his wife.","B2"
"Rosa Parks is a prime example of how an ordinary American can change the world around her. She was born in 1913, in the southern state of Alabama. Parks became famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. During the 1950s, Black Americans in the south were not allowed to ride in the front seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to get out of their seats, and go to the back of the bus, which was designated as ""Colored Only.""
 
On December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers order to surrender her seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was seated in the Colored Only section, the bus was filled, and she was required by law to give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested, and charged with civil disobedience. She later said she had grown ""tired of giving in.""
Her arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights Movement. Her arrest also lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a political and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott only lasted 21 days, it was instrumental in the Supreme Court decision to declare Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.
Parks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after her death in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the ""First Lady of Civil Rights,"" by the United States Congress, and ""The Mother of the Freedom Movement."" She has been honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal. She has been honored with her own museum in Michigan, and has received several other civil rights awards both before and after her death.","B2"
" 
Aircraft hijacking, or skyjacking is the intentional taking of an airplane usually done for political purposes. Unlike ground vehicle hijacking, which is done for financial gain for the most part, skyjacking is a darker, more dangerous, potentially life-threatening action. During the mid-1960s to the 1970s, about 160 aircraft were skyjacked worldwide. In the United States, many had taken control of aircraft, but no one had ever escaped the reach of law enforcement with one glaring exception, D.B. Cooper.
 
D.B. Cooper's real name is Dan Cooper, but his legend began as D.B. Cooper because of a mistake by the media in 1971. On November 24, Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 jetliner after purchasing a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle, Washington. Cooper demanded $200,000, and four parachutes to be delivered upon arrival to Seattle. Authorities complied with his ransom request, and Cooper let all 36 passengers, and most of the crew off the plane at that time.
Once back in the air, Cooper directed the pilot to fly to Mexico, but the jet's fuel was not enough to make there without stopping to refuel. It was decided to land in Reno, Nevada for refueling. When the aircraft reached Reno, Cooper was not on board. It is thought that Cooper jumped out of the aircraft somewhere in the wooded forests of Oregon. He had ordered the plane to fly at the lowest possible speed, and to fly at only a 10,000 foot elevation. The legend of D.B. Cooper was born.
To this date, the Cooper skyjacking is the only case that is unresolved in the United States. Cooper was never found, nor was any evidence of the $200,000, and his parachute. Many believe Cooper could not survive a drop of such a great altitude, while others say the absence of any of the money, or any evidence of his death proves he survived. In any event, D.B. Cooper is a true American legend.","B2"
"﻿From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people flock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams). They come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted – the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream. 
Here, at the central African country’s first ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple flavours. Toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. Black tea and coffee are also on sale. 
The shop, which has “ice cream, coffee, dreams” across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert – and “changing lives” in the process, says Inzozi Nziza’s manager, Louise Ingabire. 
“Ice cream is important,” she says between mouthfuls of a honey-flavoured offering. “Some Rwandans like ice cream, but it’s a new thing. We still have some work to do, to tell others that they’ll enjoy it.” 
True to Inzozi Nziza’s motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. “I didn’t have a job before: I just stayed at home. Now, I have a vision for the future. I am making money and I can give some of it to my family,” says the 27-year-old. 
Butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, Kigali, is the home of the National University of Rwanda. Inzozi Nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different. 
“It’s something uniting people here,” Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. “If you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream.” 
Most of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby Nyanza. The vanilla beans and cocoa are imported. 
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese. She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas, co-founders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn, New York, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010. 
“An ice-cream shop, Katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,” Miesen says. 
At the start, Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-profit. They did not set financial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials. 
The shop’s success is no exception, says Fatuma Ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the Rwanda Governance Board. “Small businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. Women are newcomers to big business,” she points out. “We have more women entrepreneurs. It’s an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside Kigali.” 
Though ice cream is somewhat new to Rwanda, Ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. “I think it’s great. It requires a lot of skills and changing people’s mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. I think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.” 
The Butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya, Rwanda’s first and only female drumming troupe, which was established by Katese ten years ago. 
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. 
Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows, some orphans. Others have been affected by the massacre in different ways. 
Historically, says Ingabire, Rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. “But it’s something which brings unity.” 
Ingabire’s father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. “Some of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,” she says. “When I’m drumming with them, it gives me power because we’re still alive and survivors.” 
The popular eatery features in a documentary by Rob and Lisa Fruchtman, sibling film-makers. Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers. 
The film, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the US, UK and several African states, premieres in Rwanda in 2014. “We feel the film is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,” says Lisa Fruchtman, who won an Academy Award for film- editing in 1984.

"Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most recognizable celebrities in the United States of America. The Austrian-born star came to the U.S. in the late 1960s when he was an international star in the body-building circuit. Since then, Schwarzenegger has had multiple careers as an actor, politician, and philanthropist.
 
Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. By the time he was 20 years old, he had won the prestigious Mr. Universe title. The professional body-building honor is awarded annually, but this was not his only body-building title on his resume. He won seven Mr. Olympia titles during his body-building career. Additionally, he wrote several books on the subject. His body-building career spanned from 1965 to 1980.
His film career began in 1970 when he starred in a little-known movie called Hercules in New York. However, from these beginnings, Schwarzenegger cultivated a long, and successful career as an action movie star in Hollywood. His movies are some of the most popular films to ever show in the U.S. His most recognizable role was arguably as the Terminator in the film series of the same name. Following a long and successful film career, Schwarzenegger, who was always interested in politics, began a political career that culminated with his election to two terms as California's Governor.
Schwarzenegger was first elected governor in October, 2003, running on a Republican Party platform. He enjoyed moderate success as governor in his first years, but struggled greatly after that. He had many political opponents who cited that he had no political experience, and had won the elections simply because of his popularity. Schwarzenegger's term in office was rocked by sexual misconduct allegations that tainted his political career. He remains a very popular cultural figure in the United States.","B2"
"﻿He arrived – in his own words, in 2005 – as “a simple, humble worker in God’s vineyard”. And on a grey, cold, blustery Monday in February, Pope Benedict XVI signed off in the same fashion: like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back; who can no more count on the strength of his arms. Characteristically for this most traditionally minded of pontiffs, he made his excuses in Latin. The first German pope in modern times timed his departure to the minute. “From 28 February 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican, “the see of Rome, the see of Saint Peter, will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new supreme pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is.” 
Among those present was a Mexican prelate, Monsignor Oscar Sanchéz Barba, from Guadalajara. He was in Rome to be told the date for a canonization in which he has played a leading role. “We were all in the Sala del Concistoro in the third loggia of the Apostolic Palace,” he said. “After giving the date for the canonization, the twelfth of May, the Pope took a sheet of paper and read from it. 
“We were all left …” – Sanchéz Barba looked around him in the Bernini colonnade that embraces St Peter’s Square, grasping for the word, as speechless as the “princes of the church” who had just heard the man they believe to be God’s representative on earth give up on the job. “The cardinals were just looking at one another,” Sanchéz Barba said. 
Angelo Sodano, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who must have been forewarned, delivered a brief and perhaps hurriedly composed speech. Before going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals’ loyalty and devotion, he said he and the others present had “listened to you with a sense of bewilderment, almost completely incredulous ”. At the end of his address, the Pope blessed those present, and left. “It was so simple; the simplest thing imaginable,” said Sanchéz Barba. “Then we all left in silence. There was absolute silence … and sadness.” 
John Thavis, who spent 30 years reporting on the Holy See and whose book, The Vatican Diaries, is soon to be published, said he had had an intuition the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US accordingly. A fellow-Vatican watcher confirmed this to be the case. Thavis noted that in the book-length interview Benedict gave to a German journalist, published as Light of the World in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he were no longer up to the job. “I asked myself: if I were Pope and wanted to resign, when would I choose? He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground. What is more, there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend. I thought the most likely date was 22 February, which is the Feast of the Chair of St Peter. So I got it wrong.” 
The line emerging from the Vatican within hours of the announcement was that the Pope’s decision was a brave one. By this account, Benedict – never one to shrink from utterances and decisions that shocked – had taken it upon himself to bring his church face to face with reality: the reality that contemporary medicine can keep men alive far beyond the age at which they are up to grappling with the demands of running a vast global organization. Thavis agreed: “What I find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now, when he is not sick, that he is going; and that he’s doing it because he’s tired and not because he’s particularly ill.” But is that the whole story? Does he know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public? 
Benedict’s own account of his reasons makes it clear that he took into account not only his physical, but also his psychological condition: “In order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.” Other theories will no doubt swirl around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as they did following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his election. Already there is speculation that something was about to come out about Benedict’s past. The Vatican will just as predictably dismiss such notions with contempt. But they are understandable all the same, for the transcendental importance of what Benedict has done cannot be overstated. 
Emerging from St Peter’s Basilica, Julia Rochester, from London, who described herself as a lapsed Catholic, was still turning over the implications of the Pope’s resignation. “If you’re God’s chosen one, how do you choose not be chosen?” she mused. It is a question many practising Catholics will be asking of their priests in the weeks ahead. In his first speech as Pope – humbly disclaiming his fitness for the task – Benedict said: “I am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools.” At some point in the last eight years, it would seem, he ceased to believe that was true.

"including a private gym. The seven-deck superyacht also comes with two pools, numerous jacuzzi, and a hair stylist and barber.
Yet in a global climate of haves and have-nots, is it morally justifiable to spend $1 billion on a private yacht catering for 36 guests ?
 To be honest, what ordinary mortals think is moral,is not actually relevant to these people, said Kampfner.
 You have to understand that we 're not talking about the top 1 % -- in this instance we 're talking about the 0.01 %. This is a tiny group who live in their own bubble, they mix only among themselves. 
Timm sees things differently, pointing to the employment opportunities created during the building and running of the superyacht.
 The boat will take approximately two to three million human hours to build -- not counting all the worldwide subcontractor hours, or the ready-made items already available on the market ready to be installed on the yacht, he said.
 Building the yacht at the shipyard will directly employ, at the minimum, 500 people for a period of three years. These people, who have families to support and feed, will be gainfully employed.
 And this does not include the 50 to 70 people who will work on the yacht and will be employed full time by the yacht owner, as well as others who supply the yacht. 
He extends this reasoning to the media -- You, the journalist, benefits from this build indirectly by being gainfully employed by CNN for writing this story. 
And you, the person reading this story ? Kampfer sees the public's interest in the lifestyles of the super rich as a type of luxury porn.
 There is an enormous sense of injustice which is shared not just by the poor, but also by the middle class, towards the global super rich, he said.
 But together with that however, is a sense of envy and ogling. So whether you call it confusion, or double standards, or hypocrisy, or whatever it might be -- we both abhor the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time we are endlessly fascinated by them.

"Two of Turkey's main political parties are pushing for a constitutional amendment to lift bans on headscarves at public universities, a move that has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.
The lifting of the ban on headscarves has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initiated the move, saying it would create equality in Turkey's higher education.
The constitutional commission will discuss the proposal -- submitted by the AKP and MHP parties -- in the coming days before sending it to the floor for a vote.
If approved, it would need President Abdullah Gul's approval, which is expected.
Under the proposal, veils, burqas or chaddors -- all of which cover a woman's face -- would not be allowed.
Bans on headcoverings were imposed in the early 1980s by Turkey's universities because they were seen as political symbols and conflicted with Turkey's secular governing system.
The proposal to change Turkey's constitution sent chills through Turkey's secular population. Women's groups went to parliament Tuesday to voice their rejection.
 This is a direct threat to the republic and its foundations, said Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main secular party, CHP.
Another CHP lawmaker said she fears that if the proposal is enacted, parents will feel pressure to have their daughters wear headscarves, even in elementary school.
Mustafa Akaydin, head of Turkey's Higher Education Commission, is against the proposal. He said that allowing headscarves would be a rejection of Turkey's secular system of government.
 It is an attempt to create a counterrevolution, Akaydin said. It will be a breaking point. 
He said a majority of female high school students at one school were wearing headscarves during last weekend's entry exams -- a rarity in Turkish schools.
The Higher Education Commission will meet Friday in Ankara to discuss the proposed changes. E-mail to a friend

"﻿Sir Alex Ferguson will retire as Manchester United manager at the end of the season in the 27th year of a tenure that has made him the most successful manager in British football. While he will become a United director and ambassador, the club will now have to find someone to replace a man who has won 13 English Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, the Cup Winners’ Cup, five FA Cups and four League Cups. 
Regarding his decision, Ferguson said: “The decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly. It is the right time. It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so. The quality of this league-winning squad, and the balance of ages within it, bodes well for continued success at the highest level whilst the structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one. 
“Our training facilities are amongst the finest in global sport and our home, Old Trafford, is rightfully regarded as one of the leading venues in the world. Going forward, I am delighted to take on the roles of both director and ambassador for the club. With these activities, along with my many other interests, I am looking forward to the future. I must pay tribute to my family; their love and support has been essential. My wife, Cathy, has been the key figure throughout my career, providing a bedrock of both stability and encouragement. Words are not enough to express what this has meant to me. 
“As for my players and staff, past and present, I would like to thank them all for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. Without their contribution, the history of this great club would not be as rich. In my early years, the backing of the board, and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular, gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, rather than just a football team. 
“Over the past decade, the Glazer family have provided me with the platform to manage Manchester United to the best of my ability and 
I have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive in David Gill. I am truly grateful to all of them. To the fans, thank you. The support you have provided over the years has been truly humbling. It has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and I have treasured my time as manager of Manchester United.” 
The sudden nature of Ferguson’s departure is in keeping with how the Scot stated he would leave the post after he mentioned a first retirement during the 2001/2 season before performing a U-turn. It is understood he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training on Wednesday morning. In an emotional speech, he announced he was to step down. He then took his backroom staff aside before finally addressing the rest of the staff in the canteen. 
Joel Glazer, joint owner of Manchester United, said: “Alex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he’s also a wonderful person. His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable. I will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in Moscow.” 
Avie Glazer, his brother, said: “I am delighted to announce that Alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director. His contributions to Manchester United over the last 27 years have been extraordinary and, like all United fans, I want him to be a part of its future.” 
David Gill, the outgoing chief executive, said: “I’ve had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with Alex for 16 unforgettable years – through the treble, the double, countless trophy wins and numerous signings. We knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first-class condition. Alex’s vision, energy and ability have built teams – both on and off the pitch – that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport. 
“The way he cares for this club, his staff and for the football family in general is something that I admire. It is a side to him that is often hidden from public view but it is something that I have been privileged to witness in the last 16 years. 
What he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. It has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.” 
First-team coach René Meulensteen revealed how Ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff on Wednesday morning. “I found out this morning when I came to the club,” he said. “He called us into his office and told us what decision he had taken. It’s always been on the cards – there’s speculation every season. I think the manager kept his cards close to his chest. I think he felt the time was right now and he made a decision. 
“He’s obviously a man who thinks very, very hard so I’m sure he’s put a lot of thought into making this decision. I wish him well. He’s been fantastic for this club and I hope all the fans give whoever’s going to come in the same support that he gets.”","B2"
"Fernando Torreshighly-anticipated switch to English champions Chelsea was completed just before Monday transfer window closed in a deal that his former team Liverpool said had broken the British record.
Chelsea's website reported that the Spain striker had signed a five-and-a-half-year contract, but did not disclose the fee -- which British media speculated would be about # 50 million -LRB- $80 million -RRB-.
However, it was still well short of the world-record $130 million that Spain's Real Madrid paid English club Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.
In another deal confirmed late on Monday, Benfica said that Brazil defender David Luiz had joined Chelsea in a deal worth $34 million that saw Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic sign for the Portuguese club.
 I am very happy with my transfer to Chelsea and I am looking forward very much to helping my new team-mates this season and for many years to come, 2010 World Cup winner Torres told the London side's website.
 Having played against Chelsea many times since coming to England, and in some very big games I will never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work hard to win a place in the team. I hope I can score some important goals for the supporters to enjoy this season. 
The 26-year-old scored 65 goals in 102 Premier League appearances for Liverpool after joining from Atletico Madrid in 2007 in a # 20 million deal, netting 81 in 142 games in all competitions.
Torresmove followed the news that Liverpool had agreed a club-record fee for Newcastle's England striker Andy Carroll, who handed in a transfer request in the afternoon after the 18-time English champions made an improved bid.
Just before the 2300 GMT deadline, Liverpool confirmed that the 22-year-old had signed a contract until 2016. The fee was not disclosed but it reportedly surpassed the previous British record of # 33 million -LRB- $53 million -RRB- that Manchester City paid for Brazilian Robinho in 2008.
Will deadline-day spending buck the trend ?
Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has been relatively quiet in transfer market for the past two seasons, but has this time backed coach Carlo Ancelotti with two marquee signings as his club languish fourth in the table -- 10 points behind leaders Manchester United.
The London team also announced on Monday that the Chelsea FC plc made a loss of # 70.9 million -LRB- $113 million -RRB- for the year ended June 30, 2010.
 The reduction in operating losses and increased sales in 2009-10 shows that we are moving in the right direction especially when viewed against the difficult macroeconomic environment, chief executive Ron Gourlay told Chelsea's website.
 The club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of UEFA financial fair playinitiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013. 
Latest transfer rumors on Twitter
Carroll joined Uruguay World Cup striker Luis Suarez at Liverpool, with the 24-year-old completing his $36 million transfer from Dutch club Ajax earlier on Monday to become Kenny Dalglish's first major signing in his second stint as manager.
The 24-year-old has scored 111 goals in 159 games for the Amsterdam side.
Another high-profile striker on the move Monday was Tottenham's Robbie Keane, who has agreed a loan switch to London rivals West Ham until the end of this season.
The move is likely to become permanent should the Hammers, currently bottom of the EPL, avoid relegation to the second flight.

Manager Avram Grant said after the 3-2 FA Cup win Nottingham Forest that he hoped the Republic of Ireland international would provide the spark to get the club away from the drop zone.
 He is not just a good player, he is a good character that we need in the next 14 games, the Israeli told the UK Press Association.
Tottenham, who face AC Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, were linked with a bid for Atletico Madrid's Sergio Aguero.
But the Argentina striker has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract extension with the Spanish side until 2014 and told the La Liga outfit's official website: I 'm staying here because I want to. 
Spurs manager Harry Redknapp would not confirm his interest in Aguero or other reported targets in Spain as he arrived for Monday's training session, but told Sky Sports that former England defender Jonathan Woodgate would not be leaving on loan.
Woodgate, who has returned to fitness after long-term injury, is needed as defensive cover after captain Michael Dawson was banned for three matches after being sent off in the 4-0 FA Cup defeat to Fulham, while French fellow center-back Younes Kaboul needs an operation, said Redknapp.
United States international midfielder Michael Bradley has joined English club Aston Villa from German side Borussia Monchengladbach on loan until the end of this season.
Villa boss Gerard Houllier told reporters: We 've got to prepare for the future and Michael is 23 and a very hard-working midfielder who can score goals.

"﻿Indignant waiters are calling for public support in a battle to hold on to their tips. PizzaExpress branches are to be targeted by protesters as part of an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop creaming off a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards. Campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will back their demands. 
In a policy that has outraged some employees, PizzaExpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every £1 paid when tips are given by card. The chain, which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families, makes an estimated £1m a year from the practice, according to the union Unite. 
“We believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers,” said Chantal Chegrinec, campaigns officer at Unite. “We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are by no means the only offender and we will be turning our attention to other companies after this.” 
The protests are being organized by local branches of Unite, with the first taking place at the British Museum branch of PizzaExpress in London. The union has also written to the restaurant chain’s CEO, Richard Hodgson. Unite began the campaign following a survey of its PizzaExpress members after the chain was sold to a Chinese private equity firm, Hony Capital, in 2014. One of the top issues was the 8% deduction from their tips. 
One disgruntled PizzaExpress employee, who wants to remain anonymous, said that the admin fee was costing her £3 a night. “I have worked at PizzaExpress for 15 years,” she said in a letter to Unite. “After all this time, I’m still only paid the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. So you see my colleagues and I are heavily reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages. I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, I get upset.” 
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8% of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more. Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, which is owned by Tesco. 
A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a “tronc” – a standard pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff. “We went to great lengths to set up this tronc system, which is chaired by a troncmaster and run by a committee of waiters and pizzaiolos who independently decide how tips made by electronic card payment are subsequently distributed between front- and back-of-house restaurant teams; a system run by employees for the employees,” she said. 
The chain, which sells 29m pizzas a year through its UK restaurants, denied that it profits from the admin fee. But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. Wagamama, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday all take nothing. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Benny’s, Chiquitos and Garfunkels, used to charge 10% but dropped this policy several years ago. 
Unite recently targeted ten PizzaExpress restaurants in south London, distributing leaflets to customers who were “shocked and disgusted” by the practice. PizzaExpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus but the employee who wrote to Unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, it always came as a surprise. Most would then pay the tip in cash. Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unite’s online petition. 
One waiter, who doesn’t work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain, said that at least a third of his income is from tips. He doesn’t want to be identified for fear of reprisals. “I work in a busy London branch and, on an average night, I’ll serve 150 people and take home £40 to £50 in tips,” he says. “That might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me as my basic pay is only £6.50 an hour.” 
Conservative MP Andrew Percy, who has called for a change in the law that would give restaurant staff more control over tips, said he plans to raise the issue in parliament after the summer recess.”

"Each New Year's Day, the city of Pasadena in California hosts a celebration to welcome the year with a series of events that includes the Rose Parade. The parade takes place in the center of the city on Colorado Blvd, and features numerous floats, marching bands, equestrian teams, celebrities, and honorees. It is the most popular parade in the country. It has spawned several other New Year's Day parades throughout the country. In Miami, it's the Orange Bowl Parade; in New Orleans, it is the Sugar Bowl Parade; in Arizona, it's called the Fiesta Bowl Parade. However, the Rose Parade is the oldest and best parade. Many people like to camp out in tents or in sleeping bags the night before to get the best locations to view the Rose Parade.
 
To brave the cold weather, some people bring portable heaters to keep them warm. It can get into the low 40s at night in Pasadena during the winter, so many people dress warm for the occasion. Food is another big feature at the pre-parade celebration on New Year's Eve. People bring their portable grills to cook their favorite outdoor meals right on the sidewalk. The rich aroma of the grilling food fills the night air, and most people are willing to share their food with other overnight campers. It is fun to sample different dishes from other grillers.
As night turns into morning, there is still electricity in the air. People are excited about the start of the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp. The floats are beautifully decorated in flowers, while the dancers and other performers dress in colorful costumes, some of which are made just for the parade. The marching bands come from nearby cities, high schools, and colleges. It is considered a great honor to participate in the Rose Parade.","B2"
"There may be no greater American than George Washington. Washington became the first United States President in 1789 with his unanimous victory in the first American election. He was also unanimously elected to a second term in 1793, the only president ever to garner 100 percent of the electoral votes. Washington was also the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army that fought the British when the country was not yet established.
 
His epic ""Crossing of the Delaware"" river to recover New York City is still considered one of the greatest military moves in the history of warfare. At the time of the crossing, the British had taken Boston and New York. The Continental Army was on the run and disorganized, but Washington had a plan. He decided to take his troops across the Delaware River in the middle of winter. This was a move that many military minds thought impossible, but not Washington. The Americans were able to take New Jersey, and change the course of the war.
Another landmark moment for Washington was the winter at Valley Forge. In 1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 troops into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the army suffered through a cold winter that claimed the lives of 3,000 men. When the spring arrived, instead of a demoralized, beaten group of soldiers, the army emerged battle ready, and able to continue the fight against the English in New York. The army was able to survive the fierce winter because of the training, and preparedness of Washington's officers. Washington earned the nickname, ""The Father of His Country,"" because of his military intelligence, and his concern for the people of the United States.","B2"

Thank you so much for offering to house sit for us next week. I'm only sorry we won't get to catch up properly until we get back from our trip. Anyway, here's everything I won't have time to tell you on Saturday morning.
The alarm code is 7957. Don't forget to set it when you go out and remember to turn it off when you get back home as it is LOUD!
The rabbits need feeding once a day and under no circumstances should they be allowed out of their cage in the garden as the neighbour's cats have attacked them in the past.
Please can you use the washing machine in the daytime only as it's old and noisy and the neighbours complain otherwise?
Would you mind opening all the upstairs windows for an hour in the morning as the house gets damp at this time of year?
That's about it! You'll find everything you need in the house, and help yourself to anything in the fridge or cupboards. Feel free to call or text if you have any problems/questions.
See you briefly to hand over keys on Saturday morning and looking forward to a proper chat when we get back!
Thanks again!

"Two mothers in South Africa have discovered they are raising each other’s daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010. 
But, while one of the women wants to correct the error and reclaim her biological child, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own, posing a huge legal dilemma. 
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, who cannot be identiﬁed because of a court order, described the inadvertent swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending. 
Both mothers gave birth at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, on the same day in 2010. “Nobody suspected anything,” Strydom said. 
But, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter. Strydom continued: “The man denied he was the father. A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby. She was devastated. She didn’t know what to do.” 
Eventually, she met the other mother and, since December 2013, they have been attending joint counselling sessions, arranged by the hospital. This has included meeting their biological daughters. 
Strydom said of his client: “She said there are resemblances to herself. She conveyed to me that it was traumatic. You can see it’s not easy for her. She has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else.” 
The woman reportedly became unhappy with the process and approached the children’s court in a bid to gain custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused. Strydom agreed to represent the woman, who has one elder child, pro bono. 
“It’s a tragedy. She wants the baby back but it seems the other mother is reluctant. It’s four years later: you can understand she doesn’t want to give up her baby.” 
The High Court in Pretoria has appointed the University of Pretoria’s Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children, which is the guiding principle under South African law. It must report back within 90 days. 
Strydom added: “Your guess is as good as mine what the court may decide. It’s a travesty. How do you rectify it after four years? The longer you wait, the more traumatic it will be. But, whatever happens, someone won’t be happy.” 
He said at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is currently helping with the case and providing counselling. 
The Centre for Child Law will now interview the mothers and fathers, as well as any other person with a “signiﬁcant relationship” with either of the girls. The children and mothers will undergo “full and thorough” clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist. 
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said “What’s going to happen must be in the best interests of the children. Biology is an important aspect but not the only one.” 
The families are of Zulu ethnicity and so Zulu tradition, culture and customary law will be a factor, she added. It is also still possible the ex- partner of the mother taking legal action could be the biological father of the girl who was switched. 
It is not the ﬁrst child-swap case to come to light in South Africa. In 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born. 
In 2009, in Oregon in the United States, Dee Ann Angell and Kay Rene Reed discovered that they had been mistakenly mixed up at birth in 1953 when a nurse brought them back from bathing. In 2013, in Japan, a 60-year-old man swapped at birth from his rich parents to a poor family was given compensation. He grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological siblings – and the boy brought up in his place – attended private secondary schools and universities. 
Bruce Laing, a clinical psychologist in Johannesburg, said the long-term effects of a baby swap could be “profound”, “terrifying” and “incredibly traumatizing”. He told The Times of South Africa: “An increasingly complicated situation is that some resentment towards a child that is not yours might occur. The parents might always be thinking 'What if?'”

"Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated by many people in the United States and Canada. In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to remember the first harvest of the pilgrims and puritans, groups of people from England who immigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the first Thanksgiving and dress up as pilgrims, puritans, and the Native Americans who are said to have helped the new arrivals find food to survive their first winter.
 
Most people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect upon what they are thankful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying aloud what they are thankful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is families coming together. Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest travel day of the year. People travel in planes, trains, buses, and cars to share a very special meal - Thanksgiving dinner.
What most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is the food. On Thanksgiving many families prepare large, elaborate dinners to share with friends and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the fall harvest, like cranberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast turkey is the traditional meat served. It is so common that some people call Thanksgiving Day ""Turkey Day"". The turkey is usually served with gravy and stuffing. Pies are usually served for dessert. The most common pies served are sweet potato, apple, pecan, and pumpkin.
Thanksgiving is not just celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year the President of the United States pardons a turkey, saving it from becoming someone's meal. In New York City, Macy's, a department store, holds a large parade with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street.","B2"
"﻿Robert Mysłajek stops dead. Between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track, the scientist finds what he is looking for. “Droppings!” he enthuses. Wolf sightings are so rare that the sighting of their faeces marks a good day, even for a seasoned tracker. 
But it is getting easier. There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland. The number has doubled in 15 years. Wolves are – along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine – Europe’s last large predator carnivores. Conservationists from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands are beating a path here to find out how the country has saved this protected species, slandered even in fairy tales. 
Bits of bone and hair protrude from the precious black faeces. “It ate a red deer,” says the University of Warsaw biologist. “In my lab, I can tell you all about this wolf – not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.” 
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers. “One wolf reached the Netherlands, where unfortunately it was hit by a car. They have a tremendous range. They need space. The average territory required by a Polish pack is 250 sq km,” said Mysłajek. 
“Is there any prospect of our ever being able to reintroduce wolves to Scotland?” asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a field trip to southern Poland from his college in the UK. The animal science students have spent the day observing droppings and paw prints in the spruce-clad Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians. 
Their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the British Isles for the first time since the 18th century. 
As the guest of a British charity, the Wolves and Humans Foundation, Mysłajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 and took questions from villagers about the Polish experience. “The big difference between Scotland and Poland is that we eat pork. We do not have many sheep here. 
“The similarity is that we have a lot of animals – 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. In Poland, we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boar – about 200,000 – and these are ravaging farmers’ cereal crops. Here, wolves are part of the solution,” he says. 
The scientist, who is a familiar face on Polish television, says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to 30km during a single hunt. “The Beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine individuals. This year, we have recorded five cubs, two yearlings and two adults. 
“We track them using motion-activated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow. In each family group, only one pair reproduces, once a year. All pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion.” 
Mys łajek, the son of a shepherd, is puzzled by wolves’ bad reputation. “Why does one speak of a 'lone-wolf gunman'? Why did we have to have Little Red Riding Hood?"" 
He is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs. 
Wolves are not pooches. Mysłajek says only scientific arguments – the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population – can save Europe’s wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. “Natural predators balance the ecosystem. They keep herbivores in check, thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.” 
Shoot the deer? “It is only a partial solution,” he says. “In a diverse environment, you have the so-called 'landscape of fear', where herbivores no longer spend all day grazing on the tender riverside grass. They move away, as a precaution, to avoid being trapped by a predator. This gives the vegetation a chance.” 
The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathians came into force in 1995 and nationwide in Poland in 1998. There are now resident packs in virtually all the country’s major forests. The predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off, as they are in African safari parks. 
The Polish government pays compensation for livestock killed by wolves. Mysłajek advises farmers on erecting electric fences. He has helped revive the use of two deterrents that, for reasons no one quite understands, wolves find particularly scary: red bunting (hung around sheep pens) and the bark of the fluffy white Tatra Mountain Sheepdog. 
The survival and mobility of Poland’s wolves has been helped by the country’s belated infrastructure development. In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway. Major road projects – requiring wildlife impact studies – began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals. 
Attitudes have also changed. “For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland. Beginning in the 1950s, hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month’s salary. It was carnage.” 
Mysłajek says the improvement in Polish wolves’ survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile. Packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighbouring Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. 
He claims Poland’s new government, elected in October 2015, is hostile to wolves. “The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter. There are 120,000 licensed hunters in Poland and they are influential in parliament. 
“The hunters claim wolves are a pest and that there are 4,000 of them in Poland, which is a spurious figure based on an unscientific count. This government is capable of turning back the clock.” 
Being a wolf advocate is not easy. “It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction. Most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans. They have a tremendously sensitive sense of smell.” 
The 12 British animal science students leave the Polish Carpathians without a wolf sighting; just photographs of paw prints and droppings. Entwisle is convinced that Scotland will never be able to match Poland’s success. 
“It would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer. But it would just not be viable because of the roads and sheep. 
“There would be problems with farmers. We had our industrial revolution too long ago. We ruined it for ourselves. In Britain, we like predators to be far away and to watch them on television, said Entwisle.

"""Look up in the sky! It's a bird; it's a plane. No. It's Superman!"" This is one of the most iconic lines in television history. It signaled the beginning of a new episode of The Adventures of Superman. The 1960s show is just one in a series of shows, plays, movies, and comic books that depict the ""Man of Steel."" The most iconic actor portraying Superman was Christopher Reeve. Reeve starred in four movies during the late 1970s and 80s.
 
In the 1978 movie classic Superman, Reeve was cast as the legendary American hero based largely on his physical attributes, although he was an accomplished actor. Reeve had the classic Superman look. He was 6'4"" tall, weighed 215 lbs., with a square jaw, and other manly features that made him perfect for the role. The film won critical acclaim, and multiple awards, including a ""Special Achievement Award for Visual Effects."" One of the selling points for the movie was that the special effects were so good that audience would believe that a man can fly after seeing this film.
Reeve went on to star in three sequels to the original movie, and had a very solid acting career in several movies after that. Tragically, Reeve and his family were hit with a devastating blow on May 27, 1995. Reeve was riding his horse through a steeplechase course jumping over obstacles. His horse suddenly stopped, throwing Reeve to the ground. Reeve suffered shattered vertebrae, and instantly lost the use of his arms and legs.
Reeve refused to give up. He spent the rest of his years advocating for spinal cord injury advancement in treatment and technology. He used his celebrity status to help the cause, but sadly, Reeve died at the age of 52 in 2004 due to complications from his injuries. He will always be remembered to his fans as the Man of Steel though.","B2"
"The Fourth of July is the United States' celebration of its independence from England. It is the day when the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the new country's forefathers, and is a national holiday. It has been celebrated every year since 1776. Americans hold this day as one of the most revered holidays in the country.
 
Independence Day celebrations include firework shows that are held by various organizations throughout the country. The shows are held at stadiums, recreational parks, and private homes. Additionally, many businesses have giveaways and special discounts for all residents on this day. The firework shows are best at stadiums, where they attract a large number of people. This is a recent change in the way Americans celebrate the day. In the past, most people bought their own fireworks from vendors who sell their goods in supermarket parking lots.
The reason many cities no longer allow the sales, or use of fireworks is because of the fire hazards they pose. This is why the large, professional celebrations stadiums and parks have become popular in recent years. Of course, many people still celebrate at home though. There are some cities where sales and use of fireworks are still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.
Another Fourth of July tradition is the backyard barbeque. The holiday occurs in the middle of summer, and Americans love to grill outdoors to avoid the heat inside the house. Hamburgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also prepared often. There is nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink celebrating the Fourth of July. It is a popular holiday, and it is one that has great meaning to most Americans.","B2"
"Sam squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail raked up by the car on its way up to the Big House. The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, not caring about their owner's first visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter didn't come out here unless he had to, which was just fine by Sam. The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job.
Carter came by later while Sam was chopping wood. Carter lifted his hat as if he were waiting for an appointment with the town priest, and then removed it completely as if he were talking to his mother. He pulled out a pile of paper from his back pocket and held it out.
'Don't pick up your mail often, do you?'
Sam took it without a glance and dropped the envelopes onto the bench.
'Never,' he replied and waited for Carter to say why he was here. The fact it was Carter's house was no explanation and they both knew it. Carter twisted his hat round and round, licking his lips and clearing his throat.
'Nice work fixing those fences,' he said finally.
'I'll be back to the beginning soon,' Sam said. It wasn't a complaint. A fence that took a year to repair meant another year's work to the man who did it well.
'Don't you ever want to take a holiday?'
'And go where?' A holiday meant being back out in the real world, a place even people like Carter travelled to escape from. Sam's escape was his reality and he wasn't going back.
Mr Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work.
'I've brought my son with me on this trip. He's had some trouble at school.' Mr Carter's eyes flicked up, blinked rapidly and then shifted back to the hat occupying his hands. 'Not much trouble out here for a young boy.' He attempted a laugh but it came out like a dog's bark.
The two men looked towards the northern end of the property. It stretched as far as the eye could see. Even the fences were barely visible from where they stood. However bored and rebellious a teenage boy might get, it wasn't possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest of the horses, kicking at the ground with its heavy hooves. Could the boy ride? he wondered. There was a whole load of trouble a good rider could get into out here, miles away from anyone. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father.","B2"
"We each spend an average of three years of our lives sitting on them, King George II of Great Britain died while on his in 1760 and 2.5 billion people still do not have access to one.
The humble lavatory is the unlikely subject of global celebration on Monday, as one of the world's most essential inventions but one that too many people still struggle without.
Although many of us tend to take ours for granted, campaigners hope that World Toilet Day 2012 will draw attention to what they 're calling the global sanitation crisis, with over a third of people worldwide living without a clean and private place to go.
This means that one in three people still have to defecate in the open, using fields or bushes, rivers, railway lines or roadsides, or simply a plastic bag. Others use unsanitary latrines or disease-ridden and foul-smelling buckets.
The majority of those without access to a toilet live in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia, with over half of people in Asia not having proper sanitation, according to the UK-based charity, WaterAid.
Ajara lives in a slum in the city of Gwalior in the Madhya Pradesh province of India. She told WaterAid how people in her community have to defecate on a nearby hilltop.
 There are no trees and privacy at the moment and so we have to wait until night to go there. It's difficult for old people to go and it's hard to go at night. It's also hard for grown-up girls because of the risk of sexual attack, Ajara said.
This World Toilet Day, international aid agencies are highlighting the particular risks to women of poor access to toilets. WaterAid says women are most vulnerable because they 're not only exposed to disease, but also have additional shame, harassment and risk of attack when they go out in the open.
Sandimhia Renato in Mozambique described to WaterAid how she has to cross a very dangerous bridge every time she goes to the bush to defecate.
 I think it takes 15 minutes to get to the bridge, Renato says. I come here once a day, between 4 and 5 pm. At night it is very dangerous. People get killed. A woman and a boy were killed with knives. One woman I know of has been raped. 
But it's not just the shame and inconvenience of having no private place to go to the toilet, but a huge public health issue.
When you consider that one gram of faeces can contain 10 million viruses, one million bacteria, one thousand parasite cysts and one hundred worm eggs -LRB- according to UNICEF -RRB- you can see why open defecation is so harmful to a community's health. Without a sewerage system to remove human waste and make it safe, cholera, typhoid and other infectious diseases spread quickly.
The United Nations says more than 2.7 million people die each year due to lack of sanitation. With diarrhoeal diseases killing more young children in developing countries than HIV/AIDS, malaria and measles put together, it's the second biggest cause of death in under fives, according to the World Health Organization.
Tackling it, says the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program, is extremely cost effective. It estimates that poor sanitation costs African countries around $5.5 billion a year and $53.8 billion in India is lost through associated economic impacts.
The program's study of 18 African countries found that even the time it takes people to find a discrete location to use the toilet accounted for almost $500 million in economic losses. That's before you examine the cost of healthcare, premature deaths and lost workdays due to illness.
In fact, according to the World Toilet Day organization, every dollar invested in sanitation yields a return of five dollars. Its message is that the solution to the global sanitation crisis lies not in any miraculous technological breakthroughs but in stronger political leadership and a commitment to invest in sanitation infrastructure and education.
Mahatma Gandhi for one seemed to recognized the value of the toilet to humanity when he said Sanitation is more important than independence. Campaigners for World Toilet Day will be hoping that these words resonate with today's leaders.

"A lonely old man living in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of John Lewis’s Christmas 2015 advert, as the department store puts a charitable spin on its latest multi-million pound campaign. 
Amid increasing hype around John Lewis’s seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season for many, the department store will aim to use its profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK. It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday. 
The retailer has spent £7m on a campaign that ranges from the slick TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-the- dark pyjamas, as well as areas decked out like the surface of the moon in 11 stores. 
After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals – a bear and hare, then a penguin – this time, the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, Lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally enables them to make contact. 
The ad’s strapline is: “Show someone they’re loved this Christmas”, which echoes Age UK’s own campaign: “No one should have no one at Christmas”. Profits from three products – a mug, gift tag and card – will go to the charity. 
“The charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody,” said Rachel Swift, head of marketing at John Lewis. 
The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away reinterpreted by little-known Norwegian artist Aurora. 
The ad cost £1m to make. The moon scenes were shot at the Warner Bros Studios, where the Harry Potter films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film, The Force Awakens. 
As in the last few years, John Lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on TV and social media using the hashtag #OnTheMoon. There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 – a complete coincidence, according to Swift. 
In 2014, the retailer also spent £7m on a campaign featuring a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of John Lennon’s Real Love, sung by British singer-songwriter Tom Odell. It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January, ahead of the 16.6m clocked by Sainsbury’s ad featuring First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the UK’s next most popular ad of 2014. 
Swift said that, despite the hype, John Lewis had stuck to the same strategy for the last five years. “It’s all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at Christmas,” she said. “We don’t go into it thinking, 'This is going to be huge,' just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love.” 
Sarah Vizard, news editor of trade journal Marketing Week, said John Lewis appeared to have reined in its efforts this time, with a lower- key presence in stores despite a growing army of competitors. “There are definitely a lot more brands doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with John Lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store,” she said. “John Lewis still does the emotional piece the best. This campaign is another great way of putting that across in a way that will resonate with customers. I think people will think it is really cute.” 
Among those fighting for attention in the flurry of Christmas ads was sister chain, Waitrose, which launched its Christmas ad online on social media ahead of a TV debut during The X Factor . It used the agency which has created John Lewis’s Christmas ads for years. 
Burberry has launched what is only its second festive film, featuring Romeo Beckham and Elton John, while electrical chain Currys drafted in Jeff Goldblum for its first ever dedicated Christmas ad. Asda, Lidl and Morrisons also launched their campaigns at the beginning of November. 
Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks & Spencer, which also launched its Christmas ad at the beginning of November, said that, in the first week of September, the most searched term on its website was Christmas. 
Boots, another retailer launching its festive campaign in early November, is going back to a more traditional approach after a critically acclaimed ad in 2014, which featured a family going to great lengths to get together at Christmas.

"a structured instrument based on one or more underlying assets -- that is sold as a fund but trades like a stock.
The ETF in question was one which tracked the volatile silver futures market and was priced in Swiss francs, they say. Adoboli's job would have been to hedge, or reduce, the bank's risk on the silver and franc positions by buying and selling each.
It is thought that he may accidentally have left the Swiss franc vs U.S. dollar side of the equation uncovered and got stung when the Swiss national bank intervened to defend the franc in early September.
Credit rating agency Moody's has said it is looking at UBS for a possible downgrade.
Its review of UBS will focus on ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement.
Moody's downgraded two French banks earlier this week amid questions over their exposure to debt.
News of the alleged rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in Europe. Markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that Greece might default on its huge debt, sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield.
Rogue trader's impact on UBS
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is attending a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed.
Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies are also present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month.
On Thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at UBS -- came word that the Federal Reserve and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to Europe's struggling banks.
The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt.
European banks have seen U.S. dollars flow out as U.S. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to European banks, amid fears over those institutionsexposure to debt held by Greece and other European nations.

As to the epidosde at UBS, Silva, the analyst, outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place: intentional fraud, basic stupidity in trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls fat fingers, which means typing the wrong number by accident.
Perhaps the trader put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem, Silva said.
Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job.
 Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam. With the volatility in banking stocks, commodities and currencies, things can go wrong really, really easily. If you 're worried about your job and you try to hide -LRB- a mistake or loss -RRB-, you can see how these situations arise. 
A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said.
 He must have done something that he was n't supposed to do, obviously, van Dam said.
UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
But the unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading.
Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year.
Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997.
Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie Rogue Trader, lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close.
UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
There is a much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clientsexposure to investment banking losses, he said.
He favors that alternative, he said.
 The banks are too large, van Dam said. The products are so complicated, and the management does n't understand it. 
UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that.

"﻿Sweden is the best country for older people, Afghanistan the worst – but general affluence does not necessarily mean better conditions for the over-60s, according to the first global index on ageing. While Sweden’s top ranking – followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada – may be predictable, the Global AgeWatch index throws up some surprising results. 
The US, the world’s richest country, is down in eighth place, while the UK fails to make the top ten at number 13. Sri Lanka ranks 36, well above Pakistan at 89, despite similar levels of gross domestic product (GDP). Bolivia and Mauritius score higher than the size of their economies may suggest, while the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China are a mixed bag. Brazil and China rank relatively high on the index; India and Russia are much lower. 
“This survey shows that history counts,” said Mark Gorman, director of the HelpAge International advocacy group. “The top-ranked countries are what you would expect, but Scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced universal pensions. The older population in Sri Lanka today is benefiting from good basic education and health care – those countries made certain policy choices. Everybody faces scarce resources, but they should not forget that, when they make investment decisions, they should also address issues of old age.” 
The index, developed with the UN Fund for Population and Development, spans 91 countries and 89% of the world’s older people. The survey comes amid a major demographic shift: by 2050, there are expected to be two billion people aged 60 and over, who will comprise more than a fifth of the world’s population. 
Population ageing – when older people account for an increasingly large proportion of people – is happening fastest in developing countries. 
More than two-thirds of older people live in poor countries; by 2050, this proportion is expected to be about four-fifths. While it took 115 years for the older population of France to double from 7% to 14% between 1865 and 1980, Brazil is likely to make the same shift between 2011 and 2032 – in just 21 years. 
The index shows that the fastest ageing countries – Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Vietnam, where the number of older people is predicted to more than triple by 2050 – fall into the lower half of the ranking, suggesting that policymakers need to tackle ageing head-on if they are to adequately support their populations. 
There are gender differences among ageing populations, with women generally outliving men. In 2012, for every 84 men aged 60 and over, there were 100 women. Lack of paid work (hence savings), less decision-making power in the family and vulnerability to violence contribute towards the disadvantage many women face in old age. 
However, if appropriate measures are implemented, population ageing does not inevitably lead to significantly higher health care spending, according to the report, which highlights the importance of long-term investments in education and health care for older people. Bolivia, ranked 46, despite being one of the poorest countries, has introduced progressive policies for older people, with a national plan on ageing, free health care and a non-contributory universal pension. Nepal, ranked 77, introduced a basic pension in 1995 for people over the age of 70 without other pension income. Though limited in value and eligibility and with uneven coverage, it is an example of how a poor country has chosen to make a start in addressing poverty in old age. 
Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has served the ageing populations of those countries. A good education system – basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions bureaucracy – is of great benefit later in life. In the Philippines, older people have benefited from the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946, which made elementary and high school education compulsory. The same is true for Armenia, which, like other countries of the former Soviet Union, benefited from a robust education system. South Korea, a surprisingly low 67 on the ageing index, performed worse than similar countries on a GDP-per-head basis, partly because it introduced a pension only recently. 
The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings: income security, health care, employment and education, and an enabling environment. All indicators have equal weight, except for pension income coverage, life expectancy at 60, healthy life expectancy at 60 and psychological well-being. These categories were given increased weighting because of better data quality and countries were included only if there was sufficient data. 
Professor Sir Richard Jolly, creator of the human development index, said: “This groundbreaking index broadens the way we understand the needs and opportunities of older people through its pioneering application of human development methodology. It challenges countries in every part of the world to raise their sights as to what is possible.”

"﻿James Hamblin, senior editor of American magazine The Atlantic, recently joined the unwashed masses. As part of his series, ’If Our Bodies Could Talk’, Hamblin, a relatively sane- looking man, took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body. He reduced the number of showers he had and eliminated shampoo and soap when he did. In doing so, he discovered what thousands of others have: the more we fervently try to clean ourselves with soaps, body washes and those silly little body polishers, the harder our skin works to restore equilibrium, encouraging us to begin the whole bewildering process again. Showering strips the skin of its own oil and bacteria – which, many would argue, is the whole point of showering – but, apparently, this sometimes works a little too well, especially when you add hot water and cleansing products to the mix. 
You know that feeling after a shower when you feel like you’re stuck in a skin suit two sizes too small? That’s because much of your skin’s natural moisture has been washed down the drain. Additionally, our skin, much like our gut, plays host to millions of beneficial bacteria. Showering destroys these happy bacterial colonies; they’re completely wiped out by all of our frequent rubbing and scrubbing. And, when the bacteria washed off by soap repopulate, they tend to favour microbes which produce an odour – yes, too-frequent showering may actually make you smell more. When you stop showering and using soap, however, your skin goes through an initial (likely gross) adjustment period, after which the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria flourish. 
After everything was said and done, Hamblin realized what other no-soap/no-shower devotees have known for years: that the human body, functioning on its own, is actually quite lovely. It’s not just scent or aesthetics, either – although dermatologists suggest that slowing down on soap use can improve acne and eczema. 
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has very real implications for our environment. The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. That’s 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we’re infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day – sometimes more than once. 
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought. It’s becoming clear that clean water is one of the world’s most valuable commodities and one that will soon be in short supply. Add in the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and you’ve got yourself a handful of very compelling reasons to let your body go au naturel. 
If this whole thing is giving you the heebie-jeebies as you recall the last time you were cheek by jowl with those who evidently already skimp on the showers – and have clearly not reached the scent-free stage yet – relax. Many cleansing- reduction enthusiasts still use deodorant if they find it necessary (everyone’s natural scent varies in intensity and can be affected by a host of factors including diet, hydration and exercise) and hand-washing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. 
You don’t need to go cold turkey, as Hamblin did, but in between thrice-daily disinfecting sessions and giving up showers altogether there lies room for our familiar, simple advice. Reduce. Skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria flourish a little, would you?

"Protesters in a Turkish border town hit by a twin car-bombing a week ago clashed with police Saturday, as they voiced anger over the government's response to the attack.
About 50 people were killed and about 100 injured when the blasts went off in the southern town of Reyhanli, in across the border from Syria's Idlib province, on May 11. One was at the community's city hall and the other in front of a post office.
The protest Saturday began relatively peacefully but descended into chaos as running street clashes broke out with police.
Protesters threw rocks and bottles at the police, who responded by firing tear gas canisters and high-pressure paintballs. Officers also brought out a water cannon.
Women and children ran from the scene as thick clouds of tear gas spread through the streets at the heart of the confrontation.
Police prevented the protesters from reaching the site of the blasts in the center of the town, which lies in Turkey's southern Hatay province.
The police have not yet commented on the clashes, which quietened down after less than an hour.
The protest -- which started with several thousand people but dwindled to a hard core of several hundred as trouble broke out -- was intended to show support and solidarity for the people of Reyhanli in the wake of the deadly bombings.
Many people in the town are angry at the government's response and say its decision to take in Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict in their country has made Turkey a target for attacks.
The crowd chanted calls for Erdogan and the government to resign.
One family of demonstrators was mourning the death of Ayten Calim, a 20-year-old secretary from Reyhanli who was killed in the bombings last Saturday.
Her brother, Halim Calim, said, We are here to voice our pain. He and another brother carried Turkish flags and a banner with Ayten's photo on it that read, We will not forget. 
Some have criticized Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for traveling to the United States this week instead of coming to Reyhanli to show support.
Erdogan has held talks with U.S. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials in Washington.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul visited Reyhanli Thursday, when he vowed that those responsible for the car bombs would be held accountable.
Celalettin Lekesiz, governor of Hatay province, said Saturday that security forces had detained 17 people so far in connection with the bomb attacks and are hunting for four others, the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported.
All 21 suspects are Turkish nationals, he said.
Lekesiz said the security forces now had detailed information about how the suspects allegedly acquired the explosives and staged the bomb attacks, the news agency reported.
Interior Minister Muammer Guler and other Turkish officials have accused a former Marxist terror group that they say maintains relations with Al Muhabarat, Syria's intelligence services, according to Anadolu.

"﻿The sight of colleagues and acquaintances taking a drag on an e-cigarette has become commonplace. But have we reached “peak vape”? Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who comprise the vast majority of vapers, may already be on the decline. The figures will be studied closely by the major e-cigarette firms, which have poured millions into promoting a technology that was thought to have been growing in popularity. 
Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes – which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke – tripled from an estimated 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014. 
However, figures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research body backed by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vaping’s appeal may be waning. Vaping rates among smokers and ex-smokers rose steadily until the end of 2013, when some 22% of smokers and ex-smokers were vaping. But this proportion levelled out throughout 2014 before dropping to 19% during the final quarter of 2014. Early signs suggest the decline has continued into 2015. The drop is described as “statistically significant” by Professor Robert West, of UCL’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, who collates the figures for the Toolkit. 
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette firms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers. Only around 1% of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette. “Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down,” West said. “We’ve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so it’s a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or 'never' smokers using e-cigarettes. That is not to say vaping rates might not change but, at this stage, it looks like they’re staying the same.” 
The levelling off in popularity of vaping in the UK would appear to be at odds with what is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where recent reports suggested it was growing in popularity. However, West questioned the interpretation of US data, which made little distinction between people who had once tried an e-cigarette and those who regularly vaped. 
Fears that vaping could become fashionable among young non-smokers appear to be misplaced, according to experts. Only 1.8% of children are regular users, the ASH study found. Instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults seeking to quit. “While the figures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off, their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011,” said James Dunworth, director and co-founder of ecigarettedirect.co.uk. “Our customers are still very happy with the product, and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.” 
“E-cigarettes are behaving like a souped-up nicotine patch,” West agreed. “They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective. One-third of quit attempts use e-cigarettes, which makes them by far the most popular method of stopping.” 
Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy at ASH, said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked. “Although there are indications that the market hasn’t grown in the UK for about a year, there doesn’t seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking. Using an electronic cigarette is safer than smoking; some, but not all, people find them useful to help quit smoking and there is little evidence that they are leading to an increase in young people smoking.” 
It emerged recently that the European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, something that could have an impact on their popularity. A new EC tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes to below their current levels. This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive. 
West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking. “There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors,” he said.

"Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants.
The cards only work at four stores for now: Target, Jamba Juice, Sephora and The Olive Garden. So if you 've been wondering how to give your little sister a birthday gift that combines fruit smoothies, lip gloss and unlimited breadsticks, this product is for you.
When you buy a card on the social network for a friend, they get a message informing them of the gift right away -LRB- great for scrambling at the last minute -RRB-. The cash amount is loaded on to a plastic card that is delivered in the mail, likely in some sort of paper envelope.
The recipient can then take that physical card into a physical store and buy physical goods. For an Internet company, it's all delightfully old fashioned.
The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States.
Facebook is entering a crowded field and offers a couple of features to differentiate itself from other gift cards. The gift giver can choose which of the available stores to give money to -- say $5 to cover a drink at Jamba Juice and $20 for home goods at Target. The recipient can monitor the balances on their card from the Facebook app -LRB- but they ca n't move the money between vendors, no matter how much they would rather have mascara than pasta -RRB-. Any gift amounts they get in the future are automatically added to the same card.
Facebook launched its Gifts feature in September for physical goods like chocolate, shirts, flowers and wine, as well as virtual items like donations to charity, Uber credit and Netflix subscriptions. It also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as Starbucks and iTunes. This new card is different because it will work at multiple retailers, is refillable and integrates with the Facebook app.
Even though you can see your card's balance on a smartphone, there are n't mobile payment options at the moment. Facebook cards are n't compatible with existing mobile payment technology like NFC, QR codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone. For now the company is sticking with the traditional plastic rectangle and magnetic-strip technology that is most widely accepted across the United States.
The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted.
It also may create some privacy issues. In order to receive the card, the recipient will have to share their mailing address with Facebook, which might make some people uncomfortable.
Gift cards are an easy workaround for people who do n't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift. Like cash, you know it will be useful and there's no danger of getting people something they will hate. Choosing cards from specific vendors like a favorite coffee spot or clothing store can be slightly more personal than a Visa card to be used anywhere. With this card you can mix and match stores.
Facebook has been experimenting with all kinds of money-making schemes in the past year, like paying to send messages to strangers. Most of the company's revenue comes from advertising -- 84 %, according to the latest earnings report -- but it also makes some money off games and programs like Facebook Gifts. The social network says it has more than a billion active users, and that's a largely untapped resource.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it will make money off the Card service. There are no fees for the gift giver or gift receiver, so Facebook is likely earning a percentage from the participating companies.

"The Statue of Liberty, arguably one of New York City’s most iconic symbols, is a popular tourist attraction for first-time visitors to the city. This 150-foot monument was gifted to the United States from France in order to celebrate 100 years of America’s independence. The statue is located on Liberty Island, and it is accessible by taking a ferry from either Battery Park in New York City or Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue’s crown.
During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue’s exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!
After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can’t wait to return to the city in the future.","C1"
"London is a famous and historic city. It is the capital of England in the United Kingdom. The city is quite popular for international tourism because London is home to one of the oldest-standing monarchies in the western hemisphere. Rita and Joanne recently traveled to London. They were very excited for their trip because this was their first journey overseas from the United States.
Among the popular sights that Rita and Joanne visited are Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. Big Ben is one of London’s most famous monuments. It is a large clock tower located at the northern end of Westminster Palace. The clock tower is 96 meters tall. Unfortunately, Rita and Joanne were only able to view the tower from the outside. The women learned that the tower’s interior is undergoing renovations until 2021.
Fortunately, the London Eye, the city’s famous Ferris wheel, was open to the public. The London Eye is situated along the southern shores of the Thames River. This attraction stands 135 meters high. It is one of London’s most well-known spots for gaining aerial views of the city. Each capsule of the Ferris wheel can hold up to 25 passengers. When their capsule stopped at the top of the Ferris wheel, the women took spectacular panoramic photographs of the beautiful cityscape below.
The last place that Rita and Joanne visited was Buckingham Palace, the home of the Queen of England. The women were impressed by the palace’s incredible architecture and historical value. Both Rita and Joanne enjoyed watching the Queen’s guards outside the palace. These guards wore red tunic uniforms, shiny black boots, and bearskin hats. Despite the women’s attempts to catch the attention of the guards, the guards are specifically trained to avoid distractions. Because of this, the guards ignored the women completely.
Joanne and Rita had an amazing time visiting the city of London, and they are inspired to seek more international travel destinations in the future.","C1"
"Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year.
The Michigan Republican made the announcement on Detroit's WJR radio station, saying he will host a syndicated radio program that will talk about national security issues and other news of the day.
 I had a career before politics and always planned to have one after, Rogers said in a statement. The genius of our institutions is they are not dependent on the individual temporary occupants privileged to serve. That is why I have decided not to seek re - election to Congress in 2014. 
Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House Speaker John Boehner, has been a staunch supporter of National Security Agency surveillance programs, which came under fire after leaks by Edward Snowden publicly disclosed their sweeping nature.
This week, he and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland -- the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee -- came up with a plan for ending the NSA's sweeping collection of bulk telephone records.
Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA
Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has stridently criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor.
He also has acknowledged public worries about government storage of surveillance data.
 That's really what we 're trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs, Rogers said recently.
Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek their temporarily renewal while Congress works on reform legislation, a senior administration official said.
Rogers is also a favorite of Sunday public affairs programming on which he frequently criticizes Obama.
He joins a cadre of House members not seeking reelection in November, but his seat in the 8th Congressional District is still considered relatively safe for Republicans.
But the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report shifted their analysis of the district from likely Republican to lean Republican for the November election following Rogersannouncement.
Democrats sought to tie together Rogers and Boehner.
 Senior Republican committee chairmen continue to flee John Boehner's broken Congress rather than defend their indefensible record of siding with special interests over middle class families that has earned them record low approval ratings, Rep. Steve Israel of New York who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Rogers became a key figure in developing U.S. national security policy, informed by his experience as an Army officer and FBI special agent.
U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8
 Mike has spent his entire life ensuring our country has been kept safe from threats both foreign and domestic, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden said in a statement. He never once let partisan politics stand in the way of doing what's right for our nation and its safety. I ca n't think of anyone who enjoys more respect from both Republicans and Democrats alike. 
Before Rogers became chairman, he issued an Intelligence Committee report on Iran's nuclear ambitions, authored a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, his Intelligence Committee biography said.
 Mike Rogers is as solid as they come -- one of those patriots willing to go to the wall to keep the American people safe, no matter the strain or sacrifice, Boehner said in a statement.

"Peruvian President Ollanta Humala has removed 30 of 55 generals in the national police, the largest such purge in the institution's history.
The forced retirements, which were announced in the official gazette over the weekend, are widely seen as an attempt by Humala to combat corruption.
Among those forced out was the head of the national police.
The new head of the police, Raul Salazar, mentioned the need to fight corruption no less than six times during a speech at his induction ceremony.
 We have to uncover any act of corruption that stains the name of the police. From the most minimal to the most important, it does n't matter, same if one sol or more are stolen, he said, referring to Peru's currency.
In a separate interview on the state broadcaster Tuesday, Salazar said that fighting drug trafficking would remain a priority.
The move means that until new generals are named, many regions in Peru, including many in the interior of the country, will be led by colonels instead of generals, something that opposition politicians have criticized.
Critics also voiced concerns that the move was a ploy by Humala, as a new president, to place commanders loyal to him in the top posts.
His interior minister, Oscar Valdes, said Tuesday that the retirements had to do with a reorganization of a bloated institution, the state-run Andina news agency reported.
 This is a studied measure, it is a re-engineering of the police, he said. It's not possible that the police has so many generals. 
Before the purge, the police had 55 generals, 900 colonels, and more than 2,000 commanders, he said.

"This week's Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, reaches a notable milestone as the tournament celebrates its 40th year -- the oldest WTA Tour event on the circuit.
The tournament has been hosted in the grounds of Stanford University for the past 14 years, after various different venues in the North California area, and its roll-call of former winners reads like a who's - who of women's tennis.
Martina Navratilova holds the record for most singles titles, with five between 1979 and 1993.
Reigning U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters has four wins, with American legends Chris Evert and Lindsay Davenport and Billie Jean King with three victories each.
And, in recognition of reaching the landmark, tournament organizers have arranged a special presentation before the semifinals on Saturday July 31.
Four former champions, each representing a different decade, will be paraded; inuaugural champion King -LRB- 1970s -RRB-, two-time champion Andrea Jaeger -LRB- 1980s -RRB-, Davenport -LRB- 1990s -RRB- and defending champion Marion Bartoli -LRB- 2000s -RRB-.
It was fitting that King won the initial tournament, as she had fought so hard for the introduction of the WTA Tour.
And, the 1971 tournament at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium, in which King beat Rosie Casals in the final of an event then known as the British Motor Cars Invitational, was to become the first of 24 events that year that formed the first-ever WTA Tour calendar.
The tournament became the Virginia Slims of California in 1974 and its venue moved around the San Francisco area before settling at the Oakland Coliseum between 1979 and 1996.
The tournament has continued to grow and grow since moving to Standford, with Stanford Director of Tennis Dick Gould telling the local Mercury News website: It's been a great marriage and just about every great player from the last 14 years has played here.
 It's been a really great thing for not only Stanford, but for the Northern California community in general. 
Australian Samantha Stosur is the top seed for the 2010 version, although injury means that the Williams sisters -- who both hail from the area -- will not be in action.

"The Marlboro Man was a fictional character who appeared in several advertising campaigns for the Philip Morris Corporation. His ads ran on television from 1964 through 1999, effectively entering the collective conscience of the American people for generations. Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco producing companies in the world, and the corporation used the Marlboro Man with great success over the years.
 
The Marlboro Man was a strong, rugged-looking man who rode a mighty horse, and traveled throughout the country promoting tobacco products. He appeared in television, radio, print, and billboard ads for decades. When the United States Surgeon General deemed tobacco smoke as unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of the end for the Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General began an anti-smoking campaign by requiring all cigarette companies to place its warning label on each package sold in the country. The warning included the wording that ""Tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer."" Soon the pressure was on the tobacco companies to curb their advertising campaigns.
In 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the Marlboro Man was introduced to the American public, that total reached $20 billion. This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also started an advertising scheme by offering genuine Marlboro Man gear for sale. These commodities were of high quality that appealed to the outdoor type of person. The gear ranged from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. It was very successful in its time. This success came at a great expense though. Four men who portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the cowboy killer. The Marlboro Man is still popular in some parts of Europe and Japan, where smoking is still in vogue.","C1"
"Former hostage Sigifredo Lopez landed in the Colombian city of Palmira to a hero's welcome Thursday afternoon, free after nearly seven years of captivity by Marxist rebels in the jungle.
A Brazilian helicopter takes off Thursday from an airport in Palmira, Colombia, to pick up Sigifredo Lopez.
Lopez was met at the helicopter that ferried him to freedom by his wife and two sons, who cried openly and deeply as they hugged him. One son held his father's head in his hands and spoke to him fervently as he kissed his forehead.
Lopez's mother also hugged him before the freed hostage was swallowed by a mob of family members of other hostages who had died in captivity.
After hugging well-wishers for more than 20 minutes, Lopez climbed into a white Red Cross sport utility vehicle and drove off in a four-vehicle convoy.
The former regional legislator was abducted April 11, 2002, by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC.
Lopez's release was the sixth unilateral one by the rebels in a week, but few of the kidnappings were as dramatic as the one in which Lopez and 11 other lawmakers were taken.
He is the only one of that group who remains alive.
A video taken by the FARC that day in April 2002 and released in late 2006 shows the first minutes of the bold kidnapping that led to his captivity.
The rebels had been training for months. At a FARC camp, they practiced in Colombian army and police uniforms and made mock-ups of the regional parliament in Cali with plastic tarps and sticks.
A rebel camera was rolling as the 20-strong commando group drove a bus to Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. Salsa music was blaring. Watch the FARC footage of the dramatic abduction of Lopez and other lawmakers 
They were posing as government soldiers. Motorcycle outriders cleared the way.
Once they reached the parliament building, they faked a bomb alert.
The bus pulled out in front of the building, and the video shows people running from the perceived threat.
On the video, an unseen rebel is heard to say, For the deputies, we have a special vehicle. 
Twelve congressmen took their seats, believing the military was shepherding them to safety. Minutes passed, and one politician asked where they are headed.
A few minutes later, the muffled reply can be heard: Ladies and gentlemen. We are the FARC. 
Back in the mountains, the hostages were herded aboard a truck. Guerrillas waved and hugged as they celebrated their audacious mission.
In 2003, Lopez and some of the other hostages appeared in a proof-of-life video. One of his colleagues simply wrote, Until when ? on his hand and held it up to camera.
Another, Jairo Hoyos, sent a prophetic plea to the president: Mister President. Those who are about to die salute you. 
Eleven of the congressmen were killed in captivity in June 2007. The FARC said they died in cross-fire during a military rescue mission. The Colombian army rejects that assertion.
When the bodies were recovered three months later, autopsies showed most had been shot multiple times in the back.
Lopez was the sole survivor. On Thursday night, he may be able to tell the rest of the world what happened that day.
FARC has released five other hostages in the past week. On Tuesday, Alan Jara, the former governor of Colombia's Meta state, arrived at the airport in Villavicencio, southeast of Bogota.
Four hostages -- three police officers and a soldier -- were released over the weekend.
Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba has brokered the releases with the help of the the International Committee of the Red Cross and a group called Colombians for Peace. Brazil also has helped, providing the aircraft used in the releases.
The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, announced the releases December 21 and designated Cordoba as the coordinator. Some analysts see these releases as a first step toward an eventual peace accord. Others suggest this is just another sign that government military gains combined with a tough right-wing political line are gradually beating the FARC into submission.
Colombia has said the rebels are still holding about 700 captives
The government recently has offered rewards to guerrillas who surrender and free hostages. Last month, two guerrillas fled their camp deep in the jungles of southern Colombia, bringing along two captives, a 14-year-old boy and a male adult who were kidnapped in December.
And a July rescue operation freed former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who had been held captive since 2002, along with three American military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members.
The government has said the FARC's military force has been severely compromised in recent months, but authorities still accuse it of trafficking huge quantities of cocaine to finance its decades-old insurgency.
Security analysts said FARC, established in the early 1960s, has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas.
The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, analysts say.

"﻿Male bosses are being paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs – a disparity that means men enjoy salary top-ups of £141,500 more than women over the course of a working lifetime. 
The figures, released by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of £6,442 in 2012 compared with £3,029 for women. In the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of £36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with £63,700 awarded to male directors. 
The latest figures highlighting the inequitable nature of pay in British business led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality. Ann Francke, the CMI’s chief executive, said: “It’s time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda. 
“This is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards. “In solving this issue, we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work. What are we waiting for?” Dr Ruth Sealy, a senior research fellow at Cranfield School of Management, added: “It is not surprising. Bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion. As to what should be done about it, these things should be made more transparent.” 
While statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the discrepancies in the sizes of awards do appear to be aggravating Britain’s pay gap, which the government says is closing but still sees full-time male employees earn 10% more than women. 
Maria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, said: “The CMI figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that, in the world of work, women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from level. “Changes in the workplace are happening and it’s good that the pay gap is closing – but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace. 
“The government is playing its part: we have made pay secrecy clauses illegal, given tribunals the power to force employers who break equal pay laws to carry out equal pay audits and signed 120 companies up to our Think, Act, Report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women. “We’ve also looked at other pay gap causes, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities, by introducing shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees.” 
Large companies such as Tesco, BT, Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think, Act, Report. The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence, having risen from 54 participants in November 2012. However, the CMI’s data did provide some evidence to support Miller’s contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses has appeared to shrink, decreasing from an average of £10,060 in 2012 to £8,502 in the CMI’s most recent figures. However, the institute cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples – which both polled around 40,000 managers – as they are not identical. 
A sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years, showed that male managers’ earnings are rising faster than women’s for the first time in five years, with men enjoying total increases of 3.2% compared with 2.8% for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined. 
At the most senior level, male directors’ earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.

"More than six decades ago, the European Movement's founder Jean Monnet shared his vision for the region's nascent union, prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars.
 The fusion of Europe's economic ties, he said, would compel its nations to fuse their sovereignty as well into that of a single European state. 
To the Frenchman, a federal Europe was the natural progression of the bloc's newfound stability.
A collection of like-minded countries whose shared goals were so clear they would willingly surrender their own governments for the group's greater good.
That was 1952. A time when the future held great promise after the horrors of the past and anything seemed possible -- even creating a new pseudo country. A place now known as the European Union.
Fast forward to the present day and, though the EU does have some shared organs of government, like a commission and parliament, it certainly is n't the set of united states Monnet hoped for. Ones with the same deep-seated convictions and beliefs.
The glue holding their common ideologies together came unstuck with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Since then, a crisis among countries sharing the euro has reopened old wounds. Ironically, instead of bringing nations together, their finances have threatened to tear them apart.
This leaves us with one fundamental question: if the EU's main task is no longer to provide peace, and it ca n't guarantee prosperity either, then what should its role be ?
Born from the ashes of Europe's turbulent past, the EU has accomplished much for its members.
It has taught its citizens value of compromise over violence, providing protection and strength in numbers.
It has boosted prosperity, thanks to the free flow of goods and labor brought about by the single market, while consumer and workersrights have been reinforced and their health improved thanks to bans on smoking.
But the EU has also drifted far from its original concept, its ranks swollen by a massive Brussels-based bureaucratic machine which, critics say, is stifling industry and is pushing members like the UK towards the exit door.
The bloc's borders have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries, stretching the definition of Europe to its limits, making membership to this formerly elite club appear more like a handy foreign policy tool rather than a cherished vision.
The EU faces a constant challenge living up to the expectations of its citizens and without two-tier policies it has no hope of serving both the bloc's strong and weak economies alike.
The EU needs a new vision a new project its people can feel passionate about.
And where better to start then this week's pivotal parliamentary elections.

"In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves.
We 've witnessed the warmest spring since record-keeping began in 1895.
Thirty-one states reached record-high temperatures.
The period between July 2011 and June 2012 was the hottest 12 months on record.
And last year 14 extreme weather-related events caused an incalculable loss of human life and cost the U.S. economy more than $55 billion. Understandably, many Americans are wondering if these events are manifestations of a longer-term shift in climate.
At present we can not definitively link any single extreme event to climate change. But it is worthwhile to consider whether the apparent increase in some extreme events has roots in a larger, longer-term trend, since that would predict a continuation of these events in the future.
That kind of understanding can have practical importance because it can inspire action to reduce economic losses and human suffering â $ often in relatively simple ways. If a region is likely to continue to get rainfall heavier than has historically occurred, for example, then it is sensible for city planners to consider installing larger-bore storm sewers when the time comes to replace aging infrastructure.
The science in this area is getting stronger all the time. In one recently published study, six international research teams led by scientists from NOAA and a number of countries investigated seven different 2011 extreme weather and climate events. In six of the seven, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that climate change caused by human activities played a factor in the events â $ affecting their severity, likelihood or frequency.
News: Extreme weather -- get ready to see more of it
Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England. On the other hand, the study found no evidence that the devastating floods in Thailand last year were connected to climate change.
Another new peer-reviewed article, the 2011 State of the Climate report compiled by nearly 400 scientists from 48 countries, documents some of the longer-term trends that are underlying some of these changes. It found that:
-- Carbon dioxide and other major greenhouse gases continue to climb, with the 2011 yearly global average the highest yet;
-- Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making oceans more acidic;
-- The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and its sea ice is thinning dramatically;
-- And the globally averaged heat stored in the upper ocean was the highest since records began in 1993.
Such striking trends have strong implications for climate, weather and environmental and human health.
One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events. Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the spring/summer 2011 wildfire season. Emergency managers along the Mississippi, Missouri and Red River basins used NOAA climate data to help lessen flooding, months before it began.
Coastal managers are using sea-level-rise data to protect crucial infrastructure.
Businesses and governments depend on climate information to make smart investments.
Electric utilities count on climate data to anticipate peak power requirements and distribute power where it is needed.
These are the kinds of practical actions that inspire me in my job as we work to make the best science available to understand and reduce the impact of extreme events on families, communities and businesses. These and other measures are essential to reducing the effects of extreme weather events and forging a safer future.

"As Halloween approaches, my 10-year-old daughter is getting excited about choosing a scary costume for trick-or-treating and the prospect of a bucket full of sweets.
I usually accompany her, but this year has stirred memories of a genuinely spooky encounter, re-awakened by a recent assignment for CNN.
The British Film Institute is about to release the full 144-minute version of The Shining -- 24 minutes more than previously seen in Europe. If you 're of a nervous disposition, the thought of subjecting yourself to additional minutes of what many regard as the most terrifying movie ever made might be a less than appealing one. But true horror fans are licking their lips in anticipation.
The film -- directed by the brilliant Stanley Kubrick in 1980 -- is now regarded as a masterclass in movie-making but at the time it was largely received with the scratching of heads and a mood of disappointment.
Kubrick adapted the film from the book written by horror novelist Stephen King -- and that's where my connection begins.
In 1974 King and his wife stayed at the majestic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, a small town at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The hotel was due to shut down for the winter season and the Kings were the only guests in the place, echoing round the long empty corridors and silent ballroom. By the time they checked out of Room 217 the next morning -- Halloween - King had the bones of his chilling story.
Stanley Kubrick treasures on display
I visited Estes Park 34 years later and decided to take my family to the Stanley Hotel.
Although Kubrick's film was shot at the Timberline Lodge in Oregon -LRB- exteriors -RRB- and Elstree studios near London -LRB- interiors -RRB- the resemblance is uncanny.
Our guide told us the hotel was inhabited by a number of ghosts, sometimes appearing in photographs as balls of energy. The warning was met with a mixture of giggles and suspiciously raised eyebrows.
We were about to shuffle along another carpeted corridor when my wife gave a cry of surprise: Look at this ! 
We gathered round her camera to see an image of the staircase on which were three orbs of light -- different sizes, different opacities, different to anything I 'd ever seen before. They had n't appeared to the naked eye nor had they appeared on anyone else's camera.
During the rest of the tour our group achieved a degree of minor celebrity by repeating the feat at several other locations within the hotel. There was one on the wood-panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we checked back through all the pictures, we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide.
The images were taken in different places, with very different lighting and of the 200 photographs we took during our holiday no orbs appeared on any other photograph -- nor indeed on any photograph ever taken on that camera before or since. We were amused and baffled but promptly forgot about them when we returned to London.
This month, covering the story of the extended version of The Shining came my way and while researching it I remembered the photographs.
So when I went to interview the film's executive producer Jan Harlan at his home in the ancient English city of St. Albans, an hour's drive north of London, I took them with me. He talked eloquently about Kubrick and his movie.
 It was a film that shows nothing but ambiguity. And this is what Stanley wanted, he said.
I showed him the pictures. He seemed amused but like me could offer no plausible explanation. They too remain ambiguous and I 'm happy for them to remain so.
But for some fans of the film, ambiguity leaves a void which must be filled with conspiracy theories. Some claim to have discovered hidden messages about anything from the Holocaust to the plight of Native Americans, and to Kubrick's apparent use of the film to confess to helping the U.S. government fabricate the Apollo moon landings.
 It's amazing how this film invited speculation and fantasy in the audience. Which is good, said Harlan. It's a great compliment to Kubrick that people go into orbit about it. 
 Orbit eh ? Is that another deliberate clue... no, I 'm not going down that road. I 'll stick to my own photographs instead. And if there is anyone out there with a good theory -LRB- conspiratorial or otherwise -RRB- about those we 'd love to hear from you.

"If your view of the world comes from watching the news and reading newspapers, you could be forgiven for lying awake at night worrying about the future. Apparently, rising violence and population rates mean humans are both killing each other in ever larger numbers and being born at rates the world's resources can't sustain. To make matters worse, all the wealth is concentrated on a handful of people in the world's richest countries. People in low-income countries live in poverty while the West gets richer. Depressing, isn't it?
But do the statistics support our negative world view or is the world actually improving?
Let's take global population first. It's around 7 billion now, in line with figures predicted by the UN in 1958. By the year 2100, the same experts predict it will be around 11 billion. But did you know that 11 billion is probably as high as that number will get? The rate of increase will slow down in the second half of this century thanks to falling birth rates today.
Falling birth rates? Yes, that's right.
In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young, fuelling rapid population growth. These large families produced even more children who survived into adulthood and had their own children. But with the wider availability of contraception in the 1960s, the global average number of babies per woman has declined from six babies per woman to as low as two.
The biggest factor in child mortality is poverty. And while it's still true that only 20 per cent of the world takes about 74 per cent of the world's income, 60 per cent of the world now falls into a middle-income group, with 11.6 per cent – the smallest amount of people in history – still living in conditions of extreme poverty. If the majority of the world's people have money, international aid could realistically achieve the UN target of eradicating poverty by 2030. As poverty goes down, life expectancy goes up, birth rates go down because parents can expect their existing children to survive, and the global population stabilises.
As for news stories that make us think the world is an increasingly violent place, there is cause for some optimism too. Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but countries are mostly co-existing more peacefully than in the past. However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, though, the statistics are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely to be a result of violent crime than political conflict, the global murder rate fell slightly, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015.
Of course, none of this means the world is perfect, and whether you personally are affected by war and poverty is often down to the lottery of where you're born. Also, we still face huge problems of our own making, particularly environmental ones like global warming, and wealth and natural resources need to be distributed more fairly. But not all the news is bad news, whatever the TV and newspapers might say.","C1"
"﻿From glow-in-the-dark trees to underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins, we look at some of the more leftfield solutions to help make our cities more livable. 
City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is increasingly not among them. Pollution, traffic and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily trials that city-dwellers have to deal with. 
Step forward the inventors. We consider ten of the wackier solutions to making our cities more livable. 
1 Pop-up parks
Today’s cities sometimes look like they’re built more for cars than people. The pop-up park is a simple idea. Take an empty car park, a pocketful of change and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park. The PARK(ing) project kicked off as an arts experiment in San Francisco and has since spread across the world. Temporary urban farms and ecology demos are just some of the ideas to have emerged out of the movement, which celebrates a day of action every September.
2 Subterranean storage
Not all urban dwellers are hooked to the car. Bikes are ever more in vogue. The question is: where to keep it safe? Tokyo-based engineering firm Giken has come up with a concept for a solution: an “ecocycle, anti-seismic underground bicycle park”. At just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep enough into the ground to house 204 bikes. Owners can retrieve their bike at the touch of a button, with the automated system delivering it back above ground in around 13 seconds.
3 Glow-in-the-dark trees
When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas baubles and fallen pine needles usually come to mind. Not Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer-artist has comes up with a “bioluminescent” plant. The experimental technology splices DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a jellyfish-type glow. Trials are underway to create an industrial-scale version of the biomimicry-inspired technology that Roosegaarde hopes could one day replace conventional street lighting.
4 Footfall harvesting
Every day, hundreds of commuters and shoppers in the east London neighbourhood of West Ham cross the elevated pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. Few probably notice the springiness beneath their feet. Fewer still connect that five-millimetre flex in the rubber surface to the powering of the streetlights above. The paved flooring is decked with smart tiles that capture the kinetic energy from pedestrians’ footsteps and convert it into electricity. Pavegen, the UK firm behind the innovation, has installed a similar system at London’s Heathrow Airport, among other international locations.
5 Supertrees
It had to happen eventually: man-made trees. Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay has a small copse of them. Up to 50 metres high, these steel-framed 'supertrees' not only have flowers and ferns growing up them but their metallic canopies act to absorb and disperse heat too. They’re equipped to harvest rainwater, too, as well as provide air ventilation for two “climate-controlled biomes” (large conservatories, in other words) below. Eleven of the 18 trees also boast solar panels along their ’branches’.
6 Water-producing billboard
We live in a consumer world. And, so we don’t forget it, advertisers wallpaper our cities and highways with banks of billboards. Researchers at Lima’s University of Engineering and Technology have come up with a billboard with a difference. Using a system of condensers and filters, it traps the humidity in the air and extracts the water vapour to produce around 96 litres of drinking water a day. The public can help themselves to it for free.
7 Neo-walled gardens
Gardens stopped being just the preserve of people’s front lawns long ago. For a while, roof gardens were all the rage. Now, it’s all about walls. Drawing on advances in hydroponics (growing plants without soil), the facades of a growing number of libraries and offices, shops and hotels are bursting into flower. One of the companies at the forefront of the “living wall” boom is UK-based firm Biotecture. The company’s “vertical gardens” can be seen gracing the Taj Hotel in central London and the exit wall of Edgware Road Tube Station, among other locations. Aesthetics aside, green walls are credited with reducing air pollution and improving air quality.
8 Algae-powered building
To prove the dynamism of the “living wall” concept, look no further than Hamburg’s International Building Exhibition. Instead of sweet-smelling flowers, the south-facing facades of the zero-carbon apartment complex are laced with green-tinged algae. The walls’ external fabric includes a “bio-skin” of hollow grass panels on which the algae photosynthesizes and grows. Periodically, the algae is harvested from the walls and fermented in a biogas plant to produce electricity.
9 Smart rubbish bins
Forget gas-guzzling dumper trucks and smelly skips. City authorities around the world are now turning to solar-powered “trash compactors” to keep litter off the streets. The 150-gallon-capacity rubbish bins are equipped with a motor that pushes down the rubbish when it nears the top. The motor is powered by solar panels embedded in the lid. The newest BigBelly bins include a wireless monitoring system that notifies rubbish collectors when the bins are full.
10 Spray paint
Finally, desperate times may sometimes call for desperate measures. That’s clearly what was going through the minds of authorities in Chengdu, one of China’s fastest growing cities. To brighten up the place, the municipal landscaping department has taken to spraying the yellowing grass green. Use of the non-toxic green spray has now spread to Tianjin and a host of other cities in China’s north-west.

"﻿You can be Aagot, Arney or Ásfríður; Baldey, Bebba or Brá. Dögg, Dimmblá, Etna and Eybjört are fine; likewise Frigg, Glódís, Hörn and Ingunn. Jórlaug works OK, as do Obba, Sigurfljóð, Úranía and – should you choose – Vagna. But you cannot, as a girl in Iceland, be called Harriet. 
“The whole situation,” said Tristan Cardew, with very British understatement, “is really rather silly.” With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriet’s passport on the grounds that it does not recognize her first name. 
Since the registry does not recognize the name of Harriet’s 12-year-old brother, Duncan, either, the two children have, until now, travelled on passports identifying them as Stúlka and Drengur Cardew: Girl and Boy Cardew. “But, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law,” Cardew, a British-born cook who moved to Iceland in 2000, said. “And that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved Icelandic name.” 
The impasse meant the family, from Kópavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave. 
Names matter in Iceland, a country of barely 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that the vast majority of Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your father’s (or mother’s) son or daughter. Jón Einarsson’s offspring, for example, might be Ólafur Jónsson and Sigríður Jónsdóttir. 
The law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must – unless both parents are foreign – be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee. 
For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas. Among its requirements are that given names must be “capable of having Icelandic grammatical endings”, may not “conflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland” and should be “written in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography”. 
What this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Iceland’s 32-letter alphabet, such as “c ”, are out. Similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down. “That was the problem with Harriet,” said Cardew. 
The country’s naming laws have come under increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Blær – “Light Breeze” – Bjarkardóttir Rúnarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to “Girl”, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution. The former mayor of Reykjavik, Jón Gnarr, has also called Iceland’s naming law “unfair, stupid and against creativity”. 
The Cardews could get round Harriet’s problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. “But it’s a bit late for that and way too silly,” said Cardew. “Are they saying they don’t want us here?”","C1"
"The servers hosting the Web sites of the House of Representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days, forcing administrators to implement the digital version of a traffic cop to handle the overload.
Servers hosting Web sites of the House of Representatives have been flooded with millions of e-mails in recent days.
 This is unprecedented, said Jeff Ventura, communications director for the House's chief administrator.
The tidal waves of e-mails and page views began after negotiators announced Sunday that a deal had been reached on legislation to enact a $700 billion bailout of the country's financial system.
In making the announcement, legislators said the public could view the agreement at financialservices.house.gov.
 In a short period of time, lots of Web users were rushing to the digital doorway to get a copy of this thing, Ventura told CNN in a phone interview.
As millions of people tried to look at the details of the bailout plan, the House.gov system became overwhelmed and many people saw notices on their computer screens saying this page does not appear. iReport.com: Do you support a bailout ?
Ventura compared the situation to the old days, when you listened to a radio show and the 10th caller got a toaster. Then everyone calls the same 1-800 number at the same time and all you got was a busy signal. 
 This was a massive digital busy signal, he said.
As more people gained access to the page and details of the bailout proposal were published in the news media, constituents then started to e-mail their representatives, Ventura explained.
 We know it's in the millions, he said of the number of e-mails that lawmakers in the House have been receiving. But we have n't counted yet, because when you 're about to get hit by a tidal wave, you do n't count the drops of water in the wave. 
After the House failed to pass the proposed deal Monday by a vote of 228-205, the e-mail volume surged again, Ventura said.
 Because there were so many e-mails, it was impacting even the presentation of House.gov, he explained.
 This morning, our engineers sounded the alarms... and we have installed a digital version of a traffic cop. We enacted stopgaps that we planned for last night. We had hoped we did n't have to. 
The office of the chief administrative officer of the House of Representatives issued a statement Tuesday saying: This measure has become temporarily necessary to ensure that congressional Web sites are not completely disabled by the millions of e-mails flowing into the system. Engineers are working diligently to accommodate this enormous traffic flow and we appreciate your patience in this matter. 
Now, when House.gov or individual memberssites begin to get overloaded, a message will come up on the computer screen saying, in effect, try back later, Ventura said.
 This really tells us that the level of constituent engagement on this issue is extremely high, he added.
He said after the failed vote Monday and the initial backlash, the House's Web site administrators thought there would be a drop in Web traffic -- especially with the Rosh Hashanah holiday.
 We monitored the situation all night long, and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday, Ventura said.
He predicted that traffic on those Web sites would start to subside once there's some guidance on the marketplace and political landscape about what comes next. 
Ventura said the House.gov Web site experienced a very high number of hits when the 9/11 commission released its final report on the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, but nothing like what the site has seen in the past few days.

"Chemical dispersants keep flowing into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the Environmental Protection Agency's order to BP to significantly scale back, according to a CNN analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command.
When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent.
Public statements at the time made by the EPA administrator gave the impression that federal officials were trying to cut down overall dispersant use.
 We expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used, Jackson said in May.
Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit. Since then, CNN's analysis shows, the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day, a 9 percent decline.
Gulf Coast environmentalists say it's another sign that the federal agencies monitoring dispersant use are not being tough enough with BP.
 I think the EPA has been struggling to respond to this crisis, said Aaron Viles with the Gulf Restoration Network. It's all really a giant science experiment and we 're terribly concerned that in the long run the impacts are going to be significant and we really do n't know what we 're doing to the ecosystem. 
But the EPA argues it deserves credit for getting alarming dispersant use under control. The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by 75 percent from the maximum daily amount used. 
And that's the catch. The highest recorded amount of dispersant used occurred on May 23, when 70,000 gallons were injected into the Gulf of Mexico. EPA officials say they feared that number would have become the norm and that's why, they say, the directive was issued.
 This escalation was quickly reversed, ensuring BP only uses the lowest volume of dispersant needed, said Adora Andy, a spokeswoman for the EPA.
But even by the EPA's own standards, BP still routinely exceeds the daily threshold. The EPA and Coast Guard say they 're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
But according to CNN's analysis, BP has gone over that amount 50 percent of the time since the May 26 directive was issued. To do so, BP must request permission from the U.S. Coast Guard.
Coast Guard officials say dispersant use is evaluated daily and that it's using the safest and most effective methods available to protect the sea environment.
 The EPA-Coast Guard directive has been successful in ensuring that BP uses the lowest volume of dispersant necessary, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Erik Halvorson, a spokesman with the Unified Area Command.
The EPA continues testing the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500, which has been used by BP since the beginning of the oil disaster. So far more than 1.6 million gallons of the chemical have been injected into the Gulf of Mexico.
But the struggle over daily dispersant use has caught the eye of Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, one of the loudest critics of BP's response in cleaning up the oil spill.
 I think it is obvious we can never again allow for a repetition of what is happening right now, where the science experiment is being conducted without having any idea what the impact on marine life long term will be, said Markey.

"Hillary Clinton sounded a populist tone in a fiery campaign appearance Wednesday, as she continued to unveil a political message ahead of the midterm elections.
 The other side has done everything it can to divide you, she told several thousand raucous fans in Louisville. This election is about the future. 
Clinton's speech comes as the former secretary of state moves back into the political sphere with a series of rallies for Democrats up this midterm cycle. On Wednesday, she rallied supporters of Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a high-profile race.
 Let's put another crack in the glass ceiling, and elect this incredible young woman to the United States Senate, Clinton exhorted the cheering audience.
Clinton criticized McConnell and politicians in Washington for causing gridlock and slowing economic growth, and she lamented the avalanche of money outside groups are dumping into the midterm elections.
She urged Kentuckians to send a new voice to the Senate.
Some of her biggest applause lines centered on pocketbook issues such as raising the minimum wage and equal pay.
 Is n't it amazing that it's 2014, and we are still debating whether women deserve equal pay for equal work ? she asked. If there's only one reason that will motivate you to go vote in the next 20 days, put that at the top of the list. 
Clinton's visit to Kentucky comes a day after the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it would stop running ads in support of Grimes.
On Thursday, Clinton heads to Michigan to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer.

"﻿For 85 years, it was little more than a featureless grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system, but, on 15 July, Pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time, revealing dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice on a scale to rival the Alps or the Rockies. 
The extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, Charon, beamed 4bn miles back to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft, mark the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly a decade. 
Alan Stern, the mission’s principal investigator, described the images as a “home run” for the team. “New Horizons is returning amazing results already. The data look absolutely gorgeous, and Pluto and Charon are just mind-blowing.” 
One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that “there are mountains in the Kuiper belt ”, the solar system’s mysterious “third zone” where Pluto sits amid around 100,000 smaller icy objects. John Spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 11,000ft high and several hundred miles across. “These are pretty significant mountains.” 
The detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater, hinting that the surface has been recently “paved over” by geological activity, which could include dramatic geysers blasting plumes of ice into the atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice rather than molten rock. 
In a nod to Pluto’s former status as the ninth planet, until it was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006, the NASA press conference began with a rundown of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. “We’ve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus,” said Dwayne Brown, NASA spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled. 
Stern described the images as “just skimming the surface” of what would be learnt about the planet during the coming year. They have already produced some surprises. Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of “exotic” ices, methane and nitrogen. “You can’t make mountains out of methane and nitrogen,” said Spencer. 
“Water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and that’s what we think we’re seeing here. This is the first time we’ve seen this. The methane and nitrogen are just a coating.” The mountains on Pluto are likely to have formed no more than 100m years ago – extremely recently given the 4.56bn-year-old solar system. This suggests the close-up region, which covers about 1% of Pluto’s surface, may still be geologically active. The images are the first to show ice mountains outside of the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process could be generating the mountainous landscape. 
The structures, together with the smoothness of Pluto’s surface, suggest that geological activity is taking place and smoothing over depressions caused by asteroid impacts. Scientists believe this “paving” process could be the result of internal heat that softens rock and ice or from snowfalls that cover the surface. For scale, the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over London, we would be able to pick out the runways at Heathrow airport. 
The distance to Pluto – 5bn km – means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take 16 months to send all the data it has accumulated during the fly-by. The team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, in honour of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930. 
The new view of Charon reveals a varied, complex terrain. An area of cliffs and troughs stretching about 1,000km suggests widespread fracturing of Charon’s surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. The image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be 7 to 9km deep. 
Cathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: “Charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today. The team has just been abuzz. 
There is so much interesting science in this one image alone.” Pluto is thought to be composed of about two thirds rock encased in a lot of ice, with surface temperatures of about minus 230C. As the £460m mission travels onwards into the Kuiper belt, scientists hope that it will open up a window on the ancient solar system and the origins of planets, potentially helping to explain the formation of the Earth itself. 
Andrew Coates, head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: “These Kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. They’re all very cold – it’s like a cosmic deep freeze. It’s the best way of preserving solar system history. That is what is so fascinating about this. It’s a really thrilling time for solar system exploration.” 
In August 2015, mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next. NASA estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and transmitting until the mid-2030s. Then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down, drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond. 
New Horizons also observed the smaller members of the Pluto system, which includes four other moons: Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos. A new sneak-peek image of Hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and its size, estimated to be about 43 by 33km. “New Horizons is a true mission of exploration, showing us why basic scientific research is so important,” said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. 
“The mission has had nine years to build expectations about what we would see during closest approach to Pluto and Charon. Today, we get the first sampling of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and I can tell you it dramatically surpasses those high expectations.” 
The observations also indicate Hydra’s surface is probably coated with water ice. Future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago.

"﻿Writing in the journal Nature, former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay argues that our reliance on GPS (global positioning system) technology is misplaced and could be eroding our innate way-finding abilities. “If we do not cherish them, our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely ever more on smart devices,” he wrote. 
McKinlay believes huge investment will be needed before navigation systems will be good enough to allow technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off. In the meantime, he argues, we need better research into systems for navigation while children should be encouraged to learn how to find their way around by more traditional means. “Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills,” he wrote. 
According to Ofcom (the Office of Communications), around 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012, making GPS technology widely available. But McKinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be wary of leaving our navigational needs to our devices. “Navigation is a use-it-or-lose-it skill,” he wrote. 
While few scientific studies have explored the issue, research from 2009 supports the notion. “What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years,” said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers, head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London, who is an author of the study. The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than those still behind the wheel. “We were able to show that their abilities did drop away if they weren’t using their knowledge on that particular test.” 
Spiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he is quick to point out that the biggest risk lies in users being unwittingly led into perilous situations. Among the fatalities blamed on satnavs (satellite navigation devices) was the death of a driver who, in 2010, plunged into a reservoir in Spain. “There is a genuine potential for risk in relying on a satnav,” said Spiers. “But the actual health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known.” 
The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities, says Spiers. While audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation, he says, the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different. “In the old days, you had to print out or take an A to Z map in your pocket – what we are doing now is just using computer- aided information and you are having to think really quite hard about where you are going and interact with this device,” he said. “The modern technology isn’t just dumbing us down completely.” 
McKinlay remains convinced that navigation technologies have a long way to go before futuristic scenarios involving driverless cars and smart cities become a reality. “For really critical applications – safety applications like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft – GPS is still not good enough,” he said. 
Though Spiers believes the development of artificial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, McKinlay remains sceptical. “We will see ever- smarter machines which are very, very task specific, but the big breakthrough will be when they are able to tune in to what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to achieve,” he said. 
Ultimately, McKinlay believes, it’s essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation. “Do you really want to encourage people to get to a point where, when it disappears or when the battery goes flat, they are in total shock and can do nothing?” he said. “Technology isn’t magic – it is just a tool.”

"﻿The view from the visitors’ centre at the southern edge of Doñana National Park in southern Spain is striking, to say the least. This is an ornithologist’s dream: 200,000 hectares of salt marsh of unrivalled importance to the birdlife of western Europe. Dozens of Britain’s most loved migratory birds, including house martins, swallows, cuckoos and warblers, rest here on their annual migrations from Africa. Doñana, a UN World Heritage Site, is also home to some of Europe’s rarest birds, including the Spanish imperial eagle, while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly endangered Iberian lynx. 
It is a glorious, vibrant landscape. Yet it exists on a knife-edge, a point illustrated dramatically in 1998 when almost two billion gallons of contaminated, highly acidic water, mixed with waste metals, poured into the park from a dam that had burst its bank at Los Frailes mine 45km to the north. A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river and over its banks, leaving a thick metallic crust over a vast stretch of parkland. More than 25,000 kilos of dead fish were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed. 
It was Spain’s worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost €90m. Suddenly aware of Doñana’s status as the nation’s most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further €360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape, which, in the 1950s and 60s, had been drained in places to create rice and cotton fields. Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state. 
It has been a costly but encouraging process. Yet the fate of Doñana still hangs in the balance thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life. Plans have been outlined to build an oil pipeline through Doñana, while other developers have announced proposals to expand local tourist resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would demand water supplies that would further erode the local table. Silt washed from nearby farms is also choking the channels that criss-cross Doñana. 
However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucían government to reopen the Frailes mine that so very nearly destroyed Doñana in 1998. “This is Europe’s most precious bird sanctuary, both in terms of indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of north-west Europe,” says Laurence Rose of the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). “Doñana already faces a great number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of its near-undoing 16 years ago. It is extremely worrying.” 
Having spent so much restoring Doñana to its past glories, it might seem strange that the local government should choose to announce that it wants mining companies to tender bids to rework Los Frailes. However, a brief examination of the state of the local economy provides an explanation. The crash of Spain’s banks in 2008 hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalucía is now more than 30%. Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 precious jobs. 
“There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants,” said Vicente Fernández Guerrero, secretary-general of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalucía. “We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area. This is a mining area. People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times, after all.” 
More to the point, added Fernández, the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste, would be allowed. (It has also stipulated that the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes cannot bid for the contract. Sixteen years after the accident, the two sides remained locked over compensation claims.) “The best technology in the world will be used here,” Fernández insisted. “Liquid will not be used. We are going to insist on that. Our tender makes that clear.” 
The proposal has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition. One road sign I passed was liberally daubed with obscenities about the workers’ union UGT, which supports the mine’s reopening. For his part, Carlos Dávila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Doñana, was also alarmed at the proposal. “This is a very, very bad idea indeed,” he told me. “They say the new mine will be safe, but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened. We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain.” 
What alarms people such as Dávila is the threat that a new mine poses to the intense investment in eco-tourism that has been made in Doñana in recent years. An example is provided at the restaurant Dehesa de Abajo, where you can have a drink or a meal surrounded by trees in which storks and black kites are nesting. 
Virtually every visitor was equipped with a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars. There is a clear tourist trade to be made from the birdlife of Doñana. Nor should this be surprising, for this is a truly special place. A vast hemisphere of sky hangs over this utterly flat but certainly not featureless landscape. Birds of every shape and size fill the air and sometimes the road. At one point on my visit, a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to fly off. 
“The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago. A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much, much more damaging impact,” said Rose. This point is backed by Dávila. “After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it,” he added. “Now, we seem to be forgetting that lesson. It is very depressing.”

TAP FOR INGREDIENTS
Method
Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7.
Whack the lemongrass against your work surface and remove the tough outer layer. Peel the shallot and ginger, deseed the chillies, then roughly chop everything with the lemongrass. Add to a large pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and the lime leaves (discard the stalks) and pound to a paste.
Toast the peanuts in a large frying pan over a medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden, then bash half into the paste. Add the tomato purée and fish sauce, finely grate in the lime zest and squeeze in all the juice, then muddle together.
With a sharp knife, score the sea bass skin at 1cm intervals in a criss-cross fashion, then rub all over with the paste, both inside and out.
Get your banana leaf (if using), or tear off a piece of baking paper five times as long as the fish and fold it in half to give you double thickness. Place the fish in the middle, then fold over to seal the fish snuggly inside. Place on a large baking tray and roast for 25 minutes, or until the flesh is succulent and comes away easily from the bone.
To make the rice, drizzle the vegetable oil into a saucepan over a medium heat. Crumble in the creamed coconut, then squeeze in the lime juice, throwing in the squeezed lime halves. Tip in the rice and fry for 2 minutes, then pour over 1 mug of boiling water and turn down the heat to low. Cover and cook for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to steam for a further 3 minutes.
For the chilli pickle, finely slice the chillies and place in a small bowl with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of salt, then mix together and leave aside.
Now make the salad. Crack open the coconut and finely grate 50g of flesh into a serving bowl. Halve the sugar snaps and mangetout, finely shred both cabbages and cucumber, then peel and finely slice the mango and add it all to the bowl. Pick in most of the herb leaves, squeeze over the lime juice and toss together.
Pop the fish on a serving platter. Roughly crush the remaining peanuts in a pestle and mortar, then scatter over the salad and the fish. Drizzle the fish with the soy sauce and scatter over the remaining salad herbs.
Take the fish, chilli pickle, rice and salad to the table and let everyone help themselves.
Tips
You can pick up banana leaves at good Asian supermarkets or online. If using, briefly hold it over the flame of your gas hob – this will make it pliable, and therefore easier to wrap around your fish, but it will also get the oils going for maximum flavour.","C1"
"The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year.
But now the real work begins for each of us who took to the streets in protest. How do we channel the energy of those demonstrations into real solutions for our communities ?
I got a taste of the challenge earlier this month, when officials from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, a state adjoining New Delhi, asked if I would lead a workshop promoting teen safety and gender sensitivity for the government schools.
I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girlsschools. And so I accepted under one condition: that the principals of the district's boysschools attend as well. Because if there's one thing I 'm certain of it's that all the candlelight vigils, passion and protests will be in vain if we do n't figure out how to make men and boys part of this growing movement to transform gender relations in my country.
For more than a decade I 've worked for the poverty-fighting group CARE as a community educator on health and gender issues. I 've seen how the deep inequalities between women and men trap millions of Indian families in cycle of poverty. But along the way, I 've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives.
The fact is most people want what is best for their loved ones. Aggressive behavior toward women is n't innate. It's learned and can be unlearned. When prompted to reflect on their attitudes towards women's education, sharing domestic tasks, having girl children, and even violence, the boys and men I work with every day can and do change.
Often it starts with something simple, like the laundry.
I think of Ram, a man I worked with in the village of Pavaiya Viran. A husband and father with a macho job -- he drills underground pumps -- Ram attended sessions where he was given a chance to analyze gender roles in his life. He understood that men and boys are under pressure to express power and that when they feel weak or frustrated, their gut reaction is often to demonstrate power, even if that means violent or abusive behavior.
Ram eventually adopted a new outlook; that truly strong men do n't show power, they show care. Let the other men laugh at me for cooking and washing clothes, he told me. Why should my wife alone do all things ? 
Now I 'm not saying men doing laundry is the solution. But each time he folds the linens, Ram shows his children he respects his wife and treats her as an equal, not someone subservient.
And so I kept thinking of Ram as I gathered with the group of 53 principals from boys and girls schools earlier this month. We addressed the importance of installing security cameras at school gates, assuring a woman driver or conductor is on every school bus, and having clean, working toilets at schools so girls and boys are not forced to go outside to relieve themselves. This was all necessary. But it felt like we were playing defense. Only when the educators were forced to hold a mirror up to their own lives did it feel like we were playing offense, too.
Many acknowledged that it's their duty as parents and community leaders to lead the next generation by example. One principal realized he 'd never even considered doing household chores, not as a boy or, now, as a husband and a father. Another vowed to make gender equity a required part of parent-teacher conferences. By the end of the session, every man and woman in the room was thinking about changing not only others but also him or herself.
We have a long way to go, and not just in India. A World Health Organization global survey found that 59 % of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62 % of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30 % of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced. The problem is not confined to the developing world either. Nearly one in five women in the United States has been raped or has experienced attempted rape.
Even so, I 'm confident that the Indian people can demonstrate to the world that we 're not powerless in the face of some global epidemic. We can change. That starts by treating this moment not as some global airing of our dirty laundry but rather a national awakening to the reality that all of us -- girls and boys, women and men -- must do our part in cleaning it.

"﻿He had the tastes of a typical millionaire. He owned a gold and silver Rolex and a fleet of expensive cars. He liked to dabble in modern art. But, although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the Madrid suburbs, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that piqued the interest of Spanish authorities. 
Gao Ping, who had lived most of his adult life in Spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 Chinese bazaars across the Mediterranean country. But, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from China. 
When police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of €100, €200 and €500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. Around €12m was wheeled away in trolleys, the largest ever cash seizure by Spanish police. The gang, with Gao the alleged ringleader, stands accused of laundering up to €300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. The government prosecutor said Gao’s illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of Spain. Gao is on bail; the case has not yet come to trial. 
Law enforcement officials have long had concerns about €500 notes. Small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons. The sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in €50 notes would require a small suitcase. Cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. A less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis. 
The UK stopped distribution of the €500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was “almost entirely for criminal purposes ”. In 2009, Italy’s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. Other countries have limited their own high- denomination notes due to links to organized crime – Canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers. 
In an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified. Peter Sands, the former head of Standard Chartered Bank, has called for the abolition of high-denomination notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 Swiss Franc note and the £50. In a report for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Sands argued it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys” pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. Although criminals would switch to smaller- denomination bills, or gold or diamonds, these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable, making it more likely they will get caught, he said. 
At a conference on terrorist financing in London, the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, called on the European Central Bank (ECB) to look at whether it “should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities”. According to Europol, the purple €500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one. 
The €500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark, the 10,000 Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian lira. Several European countries favoured high- value banknotes. “It is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,” says Pia Hüttl, an affiliate fellow at the Bruegel thinktank. “The preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere.” 
Cash remains king in Germany and Austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins. The former president of Germany’s constitutional court, Hans-Jürgen Papier, told Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper Bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money, including the €500 note – “hands off my cash ”. 
Law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash. In one case that has caught the attention of police, two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit €200,000 of torn and muddy €500 notes. In the same week, €1.3m in €500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase. But, a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. “Our frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that, in many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality,” says Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europol’s financial intelligence group. “The search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange.” 
The agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the “striking anomalies” in the use of €500 notes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in Europe. Europol asked Luxembourg’s central bank to explain. “The reply we had from Luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand,” MacLeod says. “I find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.” 
This could be changing. Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be “a comfort for criminals”. Other members of the ECB’s top team, such as Yves Mersch, contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the €500 note. But, amid heightened fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice. EU finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore “appropriate restrictions” on high-value notes and report back by 1 May 2016.

"﻿The bestselling title on Amazon in the US is not Harper Lee’s hugely anticipated second novel, Go Set a Watchman, nor George RR Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series, nor even Zoella’s much-mocked but much-bought young adult hit, Girl Online . Instead, Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford is topping the charts with her colouring books for adults, taking top spots on Amazon.com’s bestseller lists. 
Basford’s intricately drawn pictures of flora and fauna in Secret Garden have sold 1.4 million copies worldwide to date, with the newly released follow-up Enchanted Forest selling just under 226,000 copies already. They have drawn fans from Zooey Deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her Facebook followers, to the South Korean pop star Kim Ki-Bum, who posted an image on Instagram for his 1.6 million followers. 
“It’s been crazy. The last few weeks since Enchanted Forest came out have been utter madness, but fantastic madness,” said Eleanor Blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the books’ publisher, small British press Laurence King. “We knew the books would be beautiful but we didn’t realize it would be such a phenomenal success.” 
And it is not just Basford who is reaping the benefits of the hordes of adults who, it turns out, just wanted something to colour in. In the UK, Richard Merritt’s Art Therapy Colouring Book sits in fourth spot on Amazon’s bestseller lists, Millie Marotta’s Animal Kingdom – detailed pictures of animals to colour – sits in seventh and a mindfulness colouring book sits in ninth. Basford’s titles are in second and eighth place – that’s half of Amazon.co.uk’s top ten taken up by colouring books for adults. 
At independent UK publisher Michael O’Mara, which has sold almost 340,000 adult colouring books to date, Head of Publicity, Marketing and Online, Ana McLaughlin, attributes the craze to the way the category has been reimagined as a means of relaxation. “The first one we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for Grown-Ups . It sold strongly and reprinted but it was in 2014 that it all really mushroomed with Art Therapy . It really took off for us – selling the anti-stress angle gave people permission to enjoy something they might have felt was quite childish,” she said. 
The Mindfulness Colouring Book pushes this perspective particularly strongly, with its publisher telling readers that it is “filled with templates for exquisite scenes and intricate, sophisticated patterns, prompting you to meditate on your artwork as you mindfully and creatively fill these pages with colour ”, and urging potential colourers to “take a few minutes out of your day, wherever you are, and colour your way to peace and calm ”. 
“I think it is really relaxing to do something analogue, to unplug,” said Basford. “And it’s creative. For many people, a blank sheet is very daunting; with a colouring book, you just need to bring the colour. Also, there’s a bit of nostalgia there. So many people have said to me that they used to do secret colouring in when their kids were in bed. Now, it is socially acceptable; it’s a category of its own. These are books for adults. The art in my books is super intricate.” 
The illustrator, who lives in Aberdeenshire, has been astonished at the reaction since she released Secret Garden in 2013. “I had a kids’ book commissioned and I told them I would like to do one for grown-ups. It really wasn’t a trend then. I drew up the first story and they thought, ‘Let’s go for it’. I was thinking simply that people like me would like to do it. My intention was just to make a book I would like to have. So it’s been a real surprise to see the category bloom.” 
She is currently working on a third book and Michael O’Mara, which already has 17 adult colouring books in circulation, will increase this to 22 by May, with forthcoming titles including The Classic Comic Colouring Book and The Typography Colouring Book. “It’s just an enormous trend and shows no signs of slowing down,” said McLaughlin, adding that those who buy the titles are keen to display their ability to stay within the lines to the world at large. 
“The pictures are all over Twitter and Instagram. People are really proud of them – they are so intricate,” she said. “You don’t have to have any artistic talent but what you create is unique. People send us pictures of them, framed and laminated. The appetite is simply enormous. I reckon people are taking their kids’ pictures off the fridge and replacing them with their own.”

"Nikolay Davydenko produced a ruthless display to beat U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Sunday.
Davydenko had dispatched world number one Roger Federer in the semifinals and re-produced the magic to see off the Argentine 6-3 6-4 in one hour and 23 minutes at the O2 Arena.
The victory in the elite, eight-man end-of-season showpiece is the highlight of the 28-year-old Russian's career, going one better than 2008 when he lost in the final to Novak Djokovic of Serbia.
Davydenko, seeded sixth, had begun the week with a thrilling three-set loss to Djokovic in round-robin play, but proceeded to rack up four straight victories, culminating in his emphatic win over fifth-ranked Del Potro.
It earned him $1.5 million and he was delighted to have captured the first major trophy of a career marked by consistency but mostly in a support role to the game's very elite.
 For me it was amazing coming here number seven and winning the tournament. I surprised myself, he said.
Del Potro looked weary after his epic three-set semifinal win over Swede Robin Soderling the previous night.
He dropped his service in the fourth ganme of the opening set and could claim only five points on his opponent's service as the Russian eased to an early lead.
The second set was tighter, with Del Potro having a break point in the sixth game.
But at 4-4 Davydenko made his move on Del Potro's service.
Two blistering passing shots set up three break points and he claimed a 5-4 lead after a long rally.
Serving for the title, he set up match point with an ace and took it when Del Potro could not return a fiece smash.
It capped a week of surprises at the new venue with world number two Rafael Nadal crashing out with three straight sets defeats and home hope Andy Murray edged out of the round-robin by Federer and Del Potro by the slimmest of margins.
Soderling, who only came into the tournament as a late reserve for the injured Andy Roddick, and Davydenko were the surprise qualifiers from the other group, with the latter going all the way after beating the Australian, French, U.S. Open and Wimbledon champions.
Del Potro acknowledged he had been beaten by the better man on the day.
 Congratulations. You are a great champion, he said.
Now Davydenko will eye his first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, which will be the next major tournament test for the leading players.
Earlier, In the doubles final, American pair Bob and Mike Bryan beat Max Mirnyi and Andy Ram 7-6 6-3 to win their third ATP Finals title and claim the number one ranking in the world at the end of the season for the fifth time.

"Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday.
Residents of Iraq's Ramadi province cast their votes this weekend during provincial elections.
The turnout of 7.5 million voters starkly contrasted with elections in 2005, when the violence and intimidation of al Qaeda in Iraq kept voters away from the polls and only 2 percent of eligible voters participated.
Faraj al-Haidari, the head of the Independent High Electoral Commission, called the turnout this year very high for provincial elections in any country. Fifty-one percent of the 14.9 million registered voters cast ballots.
Al-Haidari called the weekend voting the most important elections in the history of Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
Voting was held in 14 of Iraq's 18 provinces. The highest turnout -- 65 percent -- was in the Salaheddin province in northern Iraq, the commission said.
The lowest -- 40 percent -- was in Anbar, the Sunni heartland west of Baghdad. The sprawling desert area was dominated in 2005 by al Qaeda in Iraq.
Preliminary results from the electoral commission are expected within five days. Final numbers are due at the end of February.
CNN's Arwa Damon, who toured polling stations with U.N. observers, said she noticed an increased sense of awareness and optimism among voters, who said they felt their participation would have an impact on their lives and country.
Political analysts said this election could correct some of the political imbalances that resulted from the 2005 election. Saturday's voting also was seen as a referendum on the popularity of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
 We are trying to build a new system of government in the heart of the Islamic Middle East, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh told CNN.
 The overwhelming majority of the people of Iraq are having a stake in this process, are buying into this democratic process. 
Those elected will have regional power over the essentials Iraqis have been desperate for -- basic services and jobs, Damon reported.
Observers believe the provincial vote will be a gauge of the country's political direction and an indication of how the parliamentary elections will turn out later this year.
The results should spell out the status of the Sunni Arab Awakening movement -- which opposes al Qaeda in Iraq -- and the popularity of the Shiite factions, such as those backing al-Maliki, Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.
Officials set up tough counter-terror measures for the election, including security rings around polling stations and vigorous searches of voters.
Despite the heightened security, three mortars exploded near a polling station in central Tikrit, about 100 miles -LRB- 160 kilometers -RRB- north of Baghdad, on Saturday morning, an official with the Interior Ministry told CNN. There were no casualties.
In another incident in Tikrit, police detained four people wearing Iraqi police uniforms who they said had thrown stun grenades at voters outside a polling center.

"A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive, transportation safety investigators say.
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content -LRB- BAC -RRB- cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.
 Most Americans think that we 've solved the problem of impaired driving, but in fact, it's still a national epidemic, NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said.
The idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the United States.
NTSB looks to technology to end drunken driving in the U.S.
Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy. But she said too many people are still dying on America's roads.
The board acknowledged that there was no silver bullet, but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels.
 In the last 30 years, more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol-impaired driving. What will be our legacy 30 years from now ? Hersman asked. If we do n't tackle alcohol-impaired driving now, when will we find the will to do so ? 
Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually, the safety board said.
Under current law, a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma. That same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period, according to the calculator.
Supreme Court rules against police in drunk driving case
Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood alcohol content, and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel.
The NTSB investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues. It can not impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures, including Congress.
But the independent agency is influential on matters of public safety and its decisions can spur action from like-minded legislators and transportation agencies nationwide. States set their own BAC standards.
The board also recommended on Tuesday that states vastly expand laws allowing police to swiftly confiscate licenses from drivers who exceed the blood alcohol limits.
And it is pushing for laws requiring all first-time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed.
In the early 1980s, when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving, many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication.
But over the next 24 years, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 BAC standard, the last state falling in line in 2004.
The number of alcohol-related highway fatalities, meanwhile, dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011, the NTSB said.
Drunk-drive blood tests divide Supreme Court
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.
 I think.05 is going to come. How long it takes to get there, we do n't know. But it will happen, said the NTSB's Robert Molloy, who helped guide the staff report.
For some, the vote struck close to home.
NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15-year sentence in a related death.
Many of the recommendations are going to be unpopular, Sumwalt said. But if we keep doing what we 're doing, we 're not going to make any difference. 
The NTSB cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05.
Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said.
The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same.
CDC: Teen drinking and driving rates cut in half
A restaurant trade association, the American Beverage Institute, attacked the main recommendation, saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent BAC after consuming one drink. The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -LRB- NHTSA -RRB-.
But NHTSA told CNN on Tuesday it no longer uses that chart as there are many variables that contribute to an individual's level of intoxication. A new NHTSA chart shows a person with a 0.05 BAC level experiences reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, -LRB- and -RRB- reduced response to emergency driving situations. 
A beer industry trade group said it would examine NTSB's recommendation for lowering the blood-alcohol threshold.
 However, we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results: by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with BAC of -LRB- 0.15 -RRB- or more, said Joe McClain, president of the Beer Institute.
The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes.
NHTSA, which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data, said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower BAC standard to gather further information on that approach. 
At Tuesday's meeting, the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test.
Some 40 states already use the administrative tool, which the NTSB believes is effective because it is swift and immediate.
And the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors, which police can use to sniff the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol.
The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints. If the sensor alerts, it is grounds for more thorough testing.
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
Tuesday's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol-related crash in U.S. history. On May 14, 1988, a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Kentucky. The truck hit a school bus, killing 24 children and three adults. More than 30 others were hurt.

"Two-year-old Lakshmi Tatma, an Indian toddler born with four arms and four legs, made her first public appearance Tuesday, a week after surgeons in India successfully removed her additional limbs.
Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference.
Lakshmi, wearing a plaster cast on her legs to keep her feet up and her legs together to help her wounds heal, was carried into a news conference Tuesday as her doctors announced she was being released from intensive care.
 She is coping very well, lead surgeon Dr. Sharan Patil said. She is being carried around by her mother and her father. 
Several of her doctors, all of them smiling, described her recovery over the past week very steady and good progress, one saying she is out of the woods as far as serious medical issues are concerned. Watch the recovering little girl meet the media 
The operation a week ago lasted 27 hours and involved a team of some 30 surgeons, all specialists in pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, and plastic surgery, working in eight-hour shifts.
Lakshmi's extra limbs were part of a conjoined twin which stopped developing in the womb. It had a torso and limbs but no head, and was joined to Lakshmi at the pelvis.
Doctors said that without the surgery, Lakshmi would have been unlikely to survive beyond early adolescence.
The surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs.
When Lakshmi was born into her poor, rural Indian family, villagers in the remote settlement of Rampur Kodar Katti in the northern state of Bihar believed she was sacred. As news of her birth spread, locals queued for a blessing from the baby.
Her parents, Shambhu and Poonam Tatma, named the girl after the Hindu goddess of wealth who has four arms. However, they were forced to keep her in hiding after they were approached by men offering money in exchange for putting their daughter in a circus.
The couple, who earn just $1 a day as casual laborers, wanted her to have the operation but were unable to pay for the rare procedure, which had never before been performed in India.
After Patil visited the girl in her village from Narayana Health City hospital in Bangalore, the hospital's foundation agreed to fund the $200,000 operation.
Planning for the surgery took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital.
Many villagers, however, remained opposed to surgery and were planning to erect a temple to Lakshmi, whom they still revere as sacred. E-mail to a friend

"﻿Our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities. 
British people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their country’s wealth, when they actually “only” own 23%. Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%. 
Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. Russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%. 
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. In India, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do. 
Why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities? 
It is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. For example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not affiliate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. This will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put on census forms. 
People also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesn’t quite fit the question. Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is. In Daniel Kahneman’s terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of “fast” thinking, rather than “slow”. 
We are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our Indian sample’s massively overestimating their population’s access to the internet. Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey – and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more affluent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. In some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality – those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. But what we find, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are. 
We suffer from what social psychologists call “emotional innumeracy” when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. Cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern. 
For Britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for people’s huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to official estimates). People are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is reflected in them overstating the scale of the issues. 
But, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. For example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. Britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again – 62% are either overweight or obese. 
And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. The top 1% in Russia own 70% of the nation’s wealth, while the top 1% in New Zealand only own 18%. Half of Italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in Norway. 
The average age in India is 27; it is 47 in Japan. Only 10% of politicians are women in Brazil, Hungary and Japan, when 44% are in Sweden. 
When the reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder we’re so wrong.

"On June 17, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson explained to The New York Times reporter James Scotty Reston why he had to stay the course in Vietnam by stabilizing the South Vietnamese government so that it could fight communism.
Johnson rejected calls for withdrawal that were being made by liberal Democrats as well as the proposal for neutralization promoted by France's Charles de Gaulle.
 So the only thing you 've got left, Johnson said, is try to make this thing more efficient and more effective and hold as strong as you can and keep this government as stable as you can and try to improve it as you can and that we 're doing day and night. 
During his recent speech at West Point, President Obama rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about Afghanistan. The president, saying that the comparison with Vietnam relies on a false reading of history, pointed to three differences.
The first is that the U.S. is now part of a broad international coalition. The second is that in Vietnam the U.S. faced a broad-based popular insurgency whereas today, according to most polls, a large number of Afghans support foreign assistance. Last, Obama added, is that today Americans are responding to a very real threat that began with the vicious attack on 9/11.
Clearly, Obama feels defensive about this analogy and hopes to undercut liberal critics who are frustrated and disappointed with his decision.
In trying to separate himself from the experience of Johnson, however, Obama did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently, and he downplayed crucial aspects of the 1960s that do in fact offer warnings for today.
Mark Twain once said that history does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. Most of those who have compared Afghanistan to Vietnam do not say that the situations were exactly the same politically or strategically. Nor is it inevitable that the surge in Afghanistan will be unsuccessful.
The point of the comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that Obama faces similar challenges, as did Johnson when the Americanization of Vietnam began in the spring of 1965.
Both presidents entered the war despite the fact that many top advisers in the White House and in Congress were strongly warning against escalation.
In 1964, Johnson heard from voices ranging from Idaho liberal Frank Church to Georgia hawk Richard Russell that Vietnam was not critical to fighting communism and that the war was unwinnable. Their warnings proved to be accurate. Going into this decision, Obama heard comparable criticism as well.
Both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad domestic agenda. Johnson was much further ahead of the game when he increased the number of ground troops in the war that he inherited. The war devastated Johnson's domestic efforts. Obama faces the same threat.
Both wars have been justified as wars of necessity. With Vietnam, proponents warned that the fall of Southeast Asia to communism would vastly strengthen the Soviet Union and China.
In an era when American schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war, this warning about Vietnam also made the war seem essential. Today, the necessity stems from the claim that failure would resurrect the dangers we faced before 9/11.
And both presidents escalated wars where the path to victory and the potential costs -- in terms of human capital and budgetary obligations -- were unclear.
Despite the fact that Johnson confronted a very different kind of enemy, the risk today is enormously high. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is dealing with a war front that is notoriously treacherous, as the Soviets learned in the 1980s and the U.S. has learned since 2001. The U.S. is also depending on a highly corrupt and undependable government in Afghanistan.
While the promise of withdrawal in July 2011 might be accurate, presidential assurances of benchmarks and end games historically do n't come true. The one constant in warfare is that it is unpredictable and difficult to control. One day after Obama's speech, Defense Secretary Robert Gates indicated that the deadline was not firm.
And the administration might very well be handcuffing itself to a strategy of more warfare as it keeps offering grave warnings about what a victory by the Taliban would mean.
These warnings will make it difficult in the long run for the administration to contain the operation or to withdraw forces unless it is absolutely clear that the Taliban has been defeated.
Democrats could find themselves feeling like their predecessors in the 1950s who were under political pressure to abide by the containment arguments outlined by President Harry Truman with the Truman Doctrine in 1947 -- first with Korea in 1950 and then with Vietnam.
Obama should not be so defensive about the comparisons with Vietnam. Rather, he should use Johnson's experience to help guide him as he makes crucial decisions in the months ahead and attempts to navigate the challenges of the wartime presidency.
In a conversation with a few of his closest advisers, Johnson said in 1964 that It's damned easy to get in a war but it's gon na be awfully hard to ever extricate yourself if you get in. 
In 1965, Johnson made the mistake of excluding those who were trying to warn him about the dangers of the war. Let's hope that this time around Obama does not repeat this error.

"One of the most influential figures in human history is Charles Darwin. Darwin has been called the father of evolution for his work in evolutionary science. In the United States, Darwin has become the symbol for atheists in the country as his theory of evolution smacks in the face of creationism. His theory claims that all of earth’s species have descended from their ancestors, and that they have adapted to their surroundings throughout history. It also claims that every species has a common ancestor. Darwin introduced his theory in his landmark book On the Origin of Species in 1859.
 
His book was met with suspicion from both the scientific community and the general public, but by the 1870s, his work was beginning to gain mass acceptance. One of his most significant studies came when he sailed with the HMS Beagle, a British sea vessel, to the Galapagos Islands. The islands have been long isolated from the South American mainland, and provided him with a unique insight on the process of evolution.
While sailing from island to island, Darwin noticed similarities between island species and mainland species. Most were similar in many ways, but some had subtle differences. He also found that the same species had differences from island to island. To Darwin it was clear that the reason for the slight differences was the individual environment of each island. These islands showed Darwin the evolution process in the making.
Darwin has many critics from religious circles. A very famous caricature of Darwin depicting him as a half-human monkey was published in 1871 in response to his theory that humans evolved from ape-like creatures. He spawned a movement of non-believers called Darwinism, which includes people who feel his theories are rooted in the scientific method as opposed to religious dogma.","C1"
"North Korea is facing possibly its worst drought in 50 years, state media reported this week.
May is on track to be the driest since 1962, with rainfall of less than a quarter of an inch -LRB- 2-5 mm -RRB- recorded in major cities, including the capital, Pyongyang, the Korean Central News Agency said.
The dry conditions are expected to continue into early June, North Korea's Rodong newspaper reported, citing a state weather official.
Rain during the last 30 days has been lower than normal in the North, according to Jang Hyun-sik with the South Korean Meteorological Administration.
 On average, it is supposed to rain in the range of 70-90 mm -LRB- 2.75 to 3.5 inches -RRB- during this period, Jang said, noting that South Korean forecasters do not directly communicate with their counterparts in the North.
Rodong reported that the drought has delayed the planting of corn and has already damaged crops like wheat, barley and potatoes, but said irrigation can fight off the damage. 
North Korea's food shortages are well documented. The World Food Program says more than 6 million people in the reclusive nation do n't have enough to eat.
South Korean Unification Ministry's spokesman Kim Hyung-suk Seoul is open to allowing private organizations to provide humanitarian aid to the North.
No food aid is likely to come from the United States. Washington canceled its plan for food shipments after Pyongyang launched a rocket on April 13.
North Korea said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology.
The move torpedoed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments.

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Spain is officially clear of Ebola, the World Health Organization declared Tuesday, after no new cases were reported since a nurse's assistant who contracted the virus there tested negative for it.
Since then, 42 days have passed -- double the maximum known incubation period for the virus -- without another case, allowing Spain to be declared free of Ebola.
Spanish authorities had been monitoring 87 people who came into contact with healthcare worker Teresa Romero Ramos, 15 of whom were considered high-risk and were quarantined at a Madrid hospital, WHO said.
Another 145 hospital employees who helped care for Romero during her month-long stay at the Carlos III Hospital were also monitored.
The WHO statement said it commends Spain for the measures put in place to identify potential cases and prevent further transmission of the Ebola virus. 
Romero contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa. He died of the disease.

"During the 1970s, one of the biggest movements occurring in the United States was the fight for equal rights. Many members of American society felt disenfranchised and discriminated against, especially in the workplace. Some American workers enjoyed a living wage complete with benefits and other advantages, while others struggled to earn enough to survive. One of the most oppressed groups of workers during this time period was California farm workers.
 
The farm workers were migrant workers who came into the country mostly without documentation to work in the fertile fields of California's Great Central Valley. This region in central California has often been described as the country's fruit basket because of its rich soil and high yields. Farm workers tended these fields during the day, and lived and slept on the farm at night. They earned less than the state's minimum wage, and had no fringe benefits other American workers enjoyed. Cesar Chavez changed all that.
Cesar Chavez, the Arizona-born civil-rights activist and labor leader, became the voice of these workers, and began a movement to bring basic rights to this group. Taking the lead from the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez began a series of non-violent demonstrations protesting the deplorable conditions farm workers had to endure. Many of these workers worked much longer than eight hours a day, and received no overtime pay. Chavez, who was a farm worker himself in the 50s, led marches, and called for boycotts. These activities were very effective in changing the working conditions for farm workers and other oppressed workers.
Chavez was highly recognized during his lifetime, and his legacy increased after his death in 1993. He has reached iconic status among the Mexican-American community.","C1"
"Top aides to President Obama on Sunday signaled that some U.S. troops could start coming home from Afghanistan as soon as July 2011, but most would likely remain there for several years.
In appearances on all the major talk shows, Cabinet officials and military advisers clarified the president's position after he walked a political tightrope by announcing he will send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and that some will start coming home in 19 months.
National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones told CNN's State of the Union that the July 2011 start of withdrawal was not a cliff, it's a ramp for beginning to turn over security responsibility to Afghan forces.
Noting the U.S. strategic interests in the region, including nuclear power Pakistan next door, Jones said: We 're going to be in the region for a long time. 
Gen. David Petraeus, the head of U.S. Central Command, said on FOX News Sunday that Obama's strategy does n't trigger a rush to the exits, while Defense Secretary Robert Gates told CBS Face the Nation that there is n't a deadline. 
 What we have is a specific date on which we will begin transferring responsibility for security district by district, province by province in Afghanistan to the Afghans, Gates said.
The challenge has been to meet the need cited by military leaders for more troops and resources to wipe out terrorist networks in Afghanistan and to help the Afghan government overcome the Taliban insurgency, while satisfying the Democratic Party's liberal base, which opposes the deployment of more troops.
Gates explained the rationale for sending more forces on ABC's This Week, saying the Afghan-Pakistani border is the epicenter of extremist jihad. 
 And al Qaeda has close relationships with the Taliban in Afghanistan, and they have very close relationships with the Taliban in Pakistan, Gates continued. The Taliban in Pakistan have been attacking Pakistani civilians, Pakistani government officials, military officials, trying to destabilize the government of Pakistan. 
Any success by the Taliban in either Afghanistan or Pakistan benefits al Qaeda, Gates said, adding that any safe haven on either side of the border creates opportunities for them to recruit, get new funds and do operational planning. 
 And what's more, the Taliban revival in the safe havens in western Pakistan is a lesson to al Qaeda that they can come back, if they are provided the kind of safe haven that the Taliban were, Gates said.
In addition, Gates warned on NBC's Meet the Press that U.S. casualties will probably continue to grow as troops take on Taliban strongholds. However, Gates rejected a comparison to the Soviet Union's decision in 1985 to send more troops to bolster its occupation of Afghanistan, which ended in failure less than two years later.
 The parallel just does n't work, Gates said. The reality is the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. They killed a million Afghans. They made 5 million refugees out of Afghanis. 
In addition, he said, the Soviets acted unilaterally, while the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan involves 42 countries with a mandate from NATO.
In Congress, Republicans generally backed Obama's deployment plan but complained that announcing the start of a withdrawal was a signal to the enemy of a compromised commitment.
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the unsuccessful GOP presidential candidate last year, told NBC's Meet the Press that a strategy must be flexible to succeed, rather than limited by a set timetable.
On FOX News Sunday, Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber's second-ranking Democrat, called the July 2011 start of a withdrawal a necessary signal to Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
According to Durbin, Obama's message to Karzai was: We 're not going to make Afghanistan a protectorate of the United States. You have to change your government. You have to show that you are willing to stand up and fight for your own country. 
 I think that message is long overdue, Durbin said.

"Under Christmas trees around the world, parcels of underpants and bundles of briefs are waiting to be opened -- perhaps with a tinge of dismay -- by the men in your life.
Underwear is a big hitter on the traditional holiday gift list and now soccer stars are muscling into the market.
Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez became the latest footballer to tackle branded underwear, launching his J10 collection for Bronzini last month and posing semi-naked to show off the goods on offer.
The 23-year-old was following the lead of his Portuguese Real Madrid teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, whose CR7 underwear label recently celebrated its one-year anniversary.
David Beckham's pants hit high streets in close to 40 countries when the former LA Galaxy and Manchester United maestro teamed up with Swedish fashion store H&M in 2012.
Even though he is approaching 40 -- that's 17 years older than undies rival Rodriguez -- Beckham stripped off again this summer to model his wares.
But why do footballers choose to branch out their brand in the most intimate way ?
 Christmas comes round once a year but footballers are in the shop window continually, Steve Martin, the global CEO for brand agency M&C Saatchi Sport and Entertainment, told CNN.
 Underwear is an every day purchase and wearing the right underwear has seen it become something of a lifestyle item.
 For some of the major players, it's a natural extension of their individual brand.
 They do n't need the money. It's not about greed but it is about making the most of their true value over the short period of their career. 
Martin helps manage the branding and marketing for Ronaldo's CR7 range, which he says is available in almost 100 countries -- its main markets are in southern Europe, Asia and South America -- as well as online.
Ronaldo's luxury trunks cost $36 a pair with the briefs priced at $30 but he also stocks a basic line where trunks are $30 and briefs $17.
 The core audience -LSB- for the CR7 range -RSB- is football fans who aspire to Ronaldo's look and image, Martin adds. The age range is mainly 18-24 year olds and slightly older.
 The beauty of Ronaldo is that he cuts across quite a big demographic. 
The aesthetic allure of Ronaldo, Rodriguez and Beckham is an undeniable factor in why their underwear packs a punch.
Beckham stopped traffic as an underwear model for Emporio Armani before collaborating with H&M while the perfectly manicured Ronaldo oozes style on and off the pitch.
Rodriguez may still be baby faced but he is already winning awards for his looks, voted the world's sexiest man in 2014 by Spain's People magazine.
When this handsome trio launched their underwear collections, they not only appealed to football fans but to their gift buying wives, girlfriends and mothers too.
 I 'm sure H&M chose David Beckham because he's a very attractive, fit fellow, Seth Stevenson, New York based senior writer for Slate, told CNN.
 They also chose him because he has appeal in a lot of different places. He's famous in Asia, he's well known in the U.S. and he's married to Victoria Beckham.
 He's got some profile all over the world and they 've got stores all over the world.
 Celebrities are a popular advertising gambit because people are interested in celebrities and like to do what they do. 
The pioneer of the celebrity underwear market was, however, not a footballer but Swedish tennis ace Bjorn Borg.
After his sudden retirement from the game in 1983 at the age of just 26, the 11-time grand slam singles champion served up another winner by launching his eponymous underwear brand in 1984.
The company now sells around five million items of underwear across its male and female ranges each year and is stocked in 20 global markets.
 The Bjorn Borg name is a very strong part of this success, says the company's marketing and communications manager Jonas Lindberg Nyvang.
 He's still involved in that he comes to the office, he's informed about what we do and he's still part of the process. 
Borg's dashing good looks, like those of Beckham, Ronaldo and Rodriguez, certainly helped him cut a dash in the underwear market but sustaining a successful brand over 30 years relies on more than superficial appeal.
Sports stars arguably make natural underwear manufacturers because they understand more than most about the importance of comfort on the go.
 If you have the right underwear you feel more confidence on the court or off the court, explains Nyvang. It's important for sporting performance.
 At Bjorn Borg we focus on the perfect fit and we are also very fashion conscious. We put out underwear that makes people feel more active and attractive. 
But before you dream about wrapping up a Nigel de Jong thong or a pair of Neymar knickers for your loved ones, bear in mind it takes a certain type of star to make money from undies.
 You are talking about one-offs here, says Martin. There are probably only a handful of global sports stars that can attempt something like this.
 For every Ronaldo there are thousands and thousands and thousands of footballers who do n't make a thousandth of what he does. 
Stevenson agrees that true sporting icons stand a better chance of successfully creating a product line that is not directly connected to their core business -- but that even then there could be pit falls.

"﻿On one day in August, one in seven people on Earth, 1 billion people, used Facebook, according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. In a decade, the social network has transformed people’s relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped topple regimes and even changed the meanings of everyday words. 
“A more open and connected world is a better world. 
It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that reflects all of our values,” wrote Zuckerberg in the post announcing the numbers. These are just some of the ways his company changed everything – for better or worse. 
1 Facebook has changed the definition of “friend”
“To friend” is now a verb. And, unlike in real life, when the ending of a friendship can be deeply traumatic, it is easy to “unfriend”, a word invented to describe ditching a casual acquaintance when they are no longer enhancing your Facebook newsfeed. Although the meanings of the words “share” and “like” are essentially the same, Facebook has brought an entirely new weight to the terms. School and university reunions have become redundant – you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and you’ve seen endless pictures of your schoolmates’ babies. You won’t be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know they’re dating someone else from the romantic selfies. 
But, unlike in real life, Facebook has no hierarchy of friendships. A classmate from one project at university who you haven’t seen in 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a stag do or a colleague you’ve never actually spoken to in person – they are all Facebook friends in the same way as your closest mate or your spouse or your mum. 
It doesn’t necessarily mean we see them the same way. Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group. Facebook hasn’t changed that yet, he believes, but, in an interview with the New Yorker, Dunbar said he feared it was so easy simply to end friendships on Facebook that, eventually, there may no longer be any need to learn to get along. 
2 We care less about privacy 
There’s a wise saying: if you’re not paying for it, you’re the product. Facebook embodies that philosophy and created an entire industry from it. The astonishing thing is that users know that and they willingly hand over that information. 
Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. 
An overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a fifth give their phone number. But, as so much of a person’s life is shared online, Facebook gives a platform for everyone to cultivate an image and a fanbase. In an article for the journal Frontiers in Psychology, academics described a new phenomenon, the emergence of the “Facebook self ”. More than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to target them most effectively. But most younger users do restrict their profiles, with 60% allowing friends only. 
3 Facebook has created millions of jobs – but not in its own offices 
Facebook has essentially created an entire sector, including indirect employment for people whose job it is to make the platform work for their brand. 
“It is a tool like no other,” said Michael Tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as Vodafone and Microsoft. “Marketers have an understanding of a brand’s consumers like they have never had before. The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary. You know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.” 
And advertisers pay a lot for that. Facebook reported ad revenue was up 46%, reaching $3.32bn. Facebook is also a minefield for brands. Suddenly, rather than complaint conversations taking place over the phone with a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum, angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the page where all loyal fans of the brand have been carefully cultivated. And an injustice can go viral. 
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions 
Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook. Manchester University’s Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine. Facebook posts signalled the start of the Maidan protests during the hours after it was announced that Ukraine would not sign a free trade and association agreement with the EU, Onuch found. The posts organized live action, not just online anger. Mustafa Nayyem, the Ukraine activist, posted: “If you really want to do something, don’t just 'like' this post. Let’s meet near the monument to independence in the middle of the Maidan.” 
Many of those interviewed in Onuch’s research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening – unable to trust traditional media. 
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news 
Roughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center. About a third of Facebook users post about politics and government. 
Most people will first encounter a piece of journalism or an item of breaking news via Facebook or other social media, and most of those encounters will be on mobiles. 
Users might never have to leave the site to get their news: Instant Articles will see stories run within Facebook. It allows news companies to sell ads around their articles, gaining them 100% of that revenue, while Facebook can also sell ads around that article, with 70% of the revenue from the social network’s advertising also going to the news companies. 
Facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. It is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. For better or (often) worse, it is a directory to find, contact and glean information for almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly find themselves at the centre of the day’s biggest news story. Facebook has its own newswire, sharing the most useful user reaction to breaking stories, including pictures and videos. 
6 Users are changing Facebook 
It used to be a site to get students connected, with only elite US universities allowed access. 
In 2014, a decade after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account. And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person. 
Groups have given way to pages, writing on each other’s walls is passé and carefully curated albums have given way to instant mobile uploads. More than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet. 
We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect . “It might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Facebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.”

"Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Wednesday declared victory over fellow Republican Joe Miller in the nation's last Senate race, saying the result of her write-in candidacy was a miracle. 
 Against all odds, we as Alaskans together made history, Murkowski told cheering supporters in Anchorage.
If she prevails in a potential challenge, Murkowski would become the second person to ever win a write-in bid for the U.S. Senate.
Murkowski's statement was the climax in the state's bitter and prolonged Senate battle. It was essentially a triumphant declaration of beating back a three-pronged attack: from Miller, from the Tea Party Express, and from Sarah Palin.
 We 've said all along, we 'll wait for the votes to be counted, Murkowski Campaign Manager Kevin Sweeney told CNN.
 By any standard, this was a clear victory. This was a whuppin, Sweeney added.
Currently, Alaska's Division of Elections is counting 100,868 votes for Murkowski versus 90,448 for Miller. By that count, Murkowski leads by 10,420.
However, 8,153 of Murkowski's votes have been contested by the Miller campaign. If, as Miller's side would like, all of those contested votes are thrown out -- an almost impossible scenario to many election and legal observers -- Murkowski would still win the race with the uncontested votes alone.
 You can see that the numbers just wo n't add up, Sweeney told CNN, referring to Miller's hopes of pulling out a win despite the rising tide against him.
The Associated Press has called the race for Murkowski. If the outcome stands in the face of legal challenges, despite a count of any outstanding ballots or a potential recount from Miller, it would be only the second time a person won a write-in campaign for the Senate. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina won a write-in campaign in 1954.
At this point, Miller is conceding nothing.
In an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News, Miller said he is less cautiously optimistic given the vote tallies. But Miller was emphatic about ensuring the integrity of the vote-counting process, asserting that the difference was less than 1 percent. 
He said he may request a recount, that he wants to ensure that some military ballots were mailed out, and that the difference between his votes and Murkowski's may shift if a consistent standard for evaluating the write-in ballots is applied.
Evaluating the write-in ballots has been controversial. As Alaska's Division of Elections tallied them, some ballots that contained misspellings or variations of Lisa Murkowski have been credited as votes for her.
That issue of evaluating a voter's intent has infuriated the Miller campaign, prompting it to launch a federal lawsuit in hopes of annulling the count of misspelled or incongruous ballots. Miller's campaign blasted the Division of Electionsstandards as extraordinarily ambiguous. 
A Miller loss would be a huge slap to Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express. Palin endorsed Miller over Murkowski for the state's GOP Senate primary, and the national Tea Party group followed suit. Murkowski lost the primary in August -- and conceded the race. Shortly after, Murkowski launched a write-in bid to retain her seat.
Murkowski was first appointed to her post by her father, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski, in 2002. Palin defeated him in the 2006 GOP gubernatorial primary.

"A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, attorneys said Thursday.
A jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife.
The jury of five women and one man deliberated for slightly more than a day before deciding on the amount, attorneys for both sides said. The jurors put the total award at $5.3 million but found that Philip Morris USA was only 36.5 percent responsible for the lung cancer that plaintiffs said killed Leon Barbanell's wife.
Shirley Barbanell herself was deemed 63.5 percent responsible, the attorneys said.
Plaintiff's attorney Jonathan Gdanski said the jury found a design defect and a breach of warranty.
Philip Morris announced that it plans to appeal the case, one of thousands of Engle progeny cases, named after a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision that decertified a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry. That case involved Dr. Howard A. Engle, a Miami Beach pediatrician and smoker who served as the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit.
The decertification decision let former class members file lawsuits individually, and thousands did.
The Florida Supreme Court also allowed some factual findings about smoking causing disease be taken from Engle case and applied to the progeny cases so plaintiff's attorneys do n't have to start from square one in each of these cases, said Ed Sweda, a lawyer for the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston, Massachusetts.
The industry has balked at that. Today's verdict is the result of a severely prejudicial trial plan, said Murray Garnick, Altria Client Services senior vice president and associate general counsel, speaking on behalf of Philip Morris USA, in a written statement. From beginning to end, this case was marked by legal rulings that should be reversed on appeal, including allowing this jury to rely almost exclusively on findings by a prior jury that have no direct connection with the plaintiff in this case. 
So far, six of the eight Engle cases that have gone to trial have come back with a plaintiff's verdict, said Sweda. Another bunch are in the pipeline ready for trial this year, he said.
About Thursday's verdict, he said, This is certainly a clear indication that tobacco litigation is alive and well. 
Gdanski said his firm has more than 150 Engle cases. We 're more than happy to keep trying them, he said.

"﻿A thick crust of bird droppings is piled on the gilded balustrade of one of Britain’s most expensive properties. Pigeon skeletons lie among shattered mirrors and water streams through broken cornicing. This is The Towers, a £30m palace in “Billionaires’ Row” in north London, whose spectacular ruin has been kept secret until now. 
It is one of ten mansions in the middle of The Bishops Avenue – the heart of London’s spiralling property market – that have stood almost entirely vacant since they were bought a quarter of a century ago, it is believed on behalf of members of the Saudi Arabian royal family. Their Grecian columns are cracking into pieces and mosaic-tiled swimming pools are filled with rubble. Nature has taken over to the extent that owls have moved in. 
It is a desolate scene repeated up and down the supposedly prestigious avenue that Lloyds Bank has calculated is the second most expensive street in Britain. While more and more people struggle to get on to London’s property ladder as house prices rise at 11.2% a year, 16 mansions on the most expensive stretch of The Bishops Avenue are sitting empty, many behind padlocked gates, with their windows shuttered with steel grilles and overgrown grounds patrolled by guard dogs. 
Across the street stands another derelict mansion, worth £18m, with smashed windows and walls coated in anti-climb paint. Metal grilles block the windows of another, which has been sold for £20m. 
But that doesn’t stop the prices going up. Dryades, a mansion until recently owned by a Pakistani politician, sold for £12m in 2007 and is believed to be worth about £30m today. Heath Lodge, the scene of the 1984 murder, by silver bullet, of fashion tycoon Aristos Constantinou, is worth £13m today, after having been sold in the late 1970s for £400,000. 
The dereliction can be agonizing for people struggling to keep a roof above their heads in one of the world’s most expensive cities. One security guard working on the avenue said it was exasperating to see so many tens of thousands of square feet of property – enough to house dozens of people – falling apart. 
Royals flushed with oil wealth from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia were among the first to come to this curving road near Hampstead Heath. Iranians fled here after the fall of the shah. Now, Chinese house hunters are following Russians and Kazakhs who have spent millions securing an address estate agents tell them is as world famous as the Champs Elysées and Rodeo Drive. Recently, two mansions have been on sale for £65m and £38m, promising endless Italian marble, leather-padded lifts and luxury panic rooms. 
However, in the grounds of the empty mansions, stone fountains crumble and lawns have become bogs. Inside one, water drips through a huge crystal chandelier onto a thick carpet rotting under sections of collapsed ceiling. Moss grows through shattered bricks and mirrored tiles are scattered across a bathroom. The swimming pool is filled with a foot of brackish water and has flowers growing through its tiles. Wooden slats bulge away from the sauna. 
But it is the wreck of The Towers, a grand mansion set among acres of hornbeams, oaks and limes, that is most dramatic, with its huge, high-ceiling halls occupied by pigeons and its walls turned bright green by algae as water pours through three storeys and plinks into a vast, empty, basement swimming pool. Unopened wooden crates marked “bullet- proof glass” reveal the security fears of the previous owners. 
Today, very few people live on The Bishops Avenue full time. A security guard patrolling the pavement outside one mansion said that the owners were not there. Another, outside Royal Mansion, declined to say if anyone was home, while a member of staff at another mansion simply warned the Guardian about the guard dogs. Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, an Egyptian-born private healthcare mogul, whose personal wealth is £45m, said he was in the minority of permanent residents. 
“It’s not a neighbourly place, where you can chat over the fence,” he said. “To be honest, I have never seen what my neighbours look like. Next door, a Saudi princess spent £35m on a new house and I’ve never seen her. There are about three houses that are lived in 24/7 and half of the properties are occupied three to six months a year. The other half, who knows if they come or not?” 
The multimillion-pound wrecks are evidence of a property culture in which the world’s richest people see British property as investments. One Hyde Park, a block of apartments in Knightsbridge, is another example where more than half the flats are registered with the council as empty or second homes. 
Nevertheless, the talk on the avenue is about building £5m apartments, instead of £50m mansions, in an effort to draw people back. 
Anil Varma, a local property developer, has decided to rebuild one of the most valuable sites on the avenue as a collection of 20 apartments with a concierge, maid service, 25-metre pool, spa and cinema. 
“If you build a big house and try and sell for £30m to £40m, it won’t sell,” he said. “Locals won’t buy and so you have to bring in overseas buyers.” 
But the prospect of the avenue’s empty property being used to help solve the housing crisis remains distant. Andrew Harper, a local Conservative councillor, laughed when asked whether some of the derelict housing could become affordable homes. He said the land price would be prohibitive. 
“Very wealthy people own property there,” he said. “Sometimes they live in them and sometimes they don’t.”

"﻿A few months before he died, Carl Sagan recorded a message of hope to would-be Mars explorers, telling them: “Whatever the reason you’re on Mars is, I’m glad you’re there. And I wish I was with you.” 
Seventeen years after the pioneering astronomer set out his hopeful vision of the future in 1996, a company from the Netherlands is proposing to turn Sagan’s dreams of reaching Mars into reality. The company, Mars One, plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to set up a human colony in 2023. But there are a couple of serious snags. 
Firstly, when on Mars their bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38% of that on Earth. It is thought that this would cause such a total physiological change in their bone density, muscle strength and circulation that voyagers would no longer be able to survive in Earth’s conditions. Secondly, and directly related to the first, they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends, as the deal doesn’t include a return ticket. 
The Mars One website states that a return “cannot be anticipated nor expected”. To return, they would need a fully assembled and fuelled rocket capable of escaping the gravitational field of Mars, on-board life support systems capable of up to a seven-month voyage and the capacity either to dock with a space station orbiting Earth or perform a safe re-entry and landing. “Not one of these is a small endeavour,” the site notes, requiring “substantial technical capacity, weight and cost”. 
Nevertheless, the project has already had 10,000 applicants, according to the company’s Medical Director, Norbert Kraft. He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and, though they include women, they tended to be men. 
The reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied, he said. An American woman called Cynthia, who gave her age as 32, told the company that it was a “childhood imagining” of hers to go to Mars. She described a trip her mother had taken her on in the early 1990s to a lecture at the University of Wisconsin. 
She said the lecturer had been Sagan and she had asked him if he thought humans would land on Mars in her lifetime. Cynthia said: “He in turn asked me if I wanted to be trapped in a ’tin can spacecraft’ for the two years it would take to get there. I told him 'yes', he smiled, and told me in all seriousness, that yes, he absolutely believed that humans would reach Mars in my lifetime.” 
She told the project: “When I first heard about the Mars One project I thought, this is my chance – that childhood dream could become a reality. I could be one of the pioneers, building the first settlement on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for.” 
The prime attributes Mars One is looking for in astronaut-settlers are resilience, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust and resourcefulness, according to Kraft. They must also be over 18. 
Founded in 2010 by Bas Lansdorp, an engineer, Mars One says it has developed a realistic road map and financing plan for the project based on existing technologies and that the mission is perfectly feasible. The website states that the basic elements required for life are already present on the planet. For instance, water can be extracted from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the air we breathe. The colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels, it says. 
Mars One said it had signed a contract with the American firm Paragon Space Development Corporation to take the first steps in developing the life support system and spacesuits fit for the mission. 
The project will cost a reported $6bn, a sum Lansdorp has said he hopes will be met partly by selling broadcasting rights. “The broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to Mars,” Lansdorp said, in an interview with ABC News. 
Another ambassador to the project is Paul Römer, the co-creator of Big Brother, one of the first, and most successful, reality TV shows. 
On the website, Römer gave an indication of how the broadcasting of the project might proceed: “This mission to Mars could be the biggest media event in the world,” said Römer. “Reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching.” 
The aim is to establish a permanent human colony, according to the company’s website. The first team would land on the surface of Mars in 2023 to begin constructing the colony, with a team of four astronauts every two years after that. 
The project is not without its sceptics, however, and concerns have been raised about how astronauts might get to the planet and establish a colony with all the life support and other requirements needed. 
Professor Gerard’t Hooft, winner of the Nobel Prize for theoretical physics in 1999, is an ambassador for the project.’ T Hooft admits there are unknown health risks. The radiation is “of quite a different nature” from anything that has been tested on Earth, he said. 
The mission hopes to inspire generations to “believe that all things are possible, that anything can be achieved,” much like the Apollo Moon landings. 
“Mars One believes it is not only possible, but imperative that we establish a permanent settlement on Mars in order to accelerate our understanding of the formation of the solar system, the origins of life and, of equal importance, our place in the universe,” it says.

"Israeli troops fired on protesters trying to cross the fortified border between Syria and the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday, with Syrian authorities reporting more than a dozen dead and hundreds wounded.
The protests came on the anniversary of the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately confirm any casualties, though a spokeswoman said that Israeli troops used tear gas and live ammunition on members of an angered mob. 
 We warned them verbally -LRB- and -RRB- with warning shots into the air, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich told CNN. And when these two options failed, we had to open fire selectively into the area, and this actually stopped those Syrians from reaching the Israeli-Syrian fence. 
The Syrian state news agency said 23 people were killed and more than 350 wounded in the protests, which continued past nightfall. Medics could be seen carrying the wounded to vehicles and driving them away from the border.
A spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the violence and urged restraint.
 The events of today and of 15 May on the Golan put the long-held cease-fire in jeopardy. The Secretary-General calls for maximum restraint on all sides and strict observance of international humanitarian law to ensure protection of civilians, he said.
As many as 500 people took part in the demonstration, holding mid-day prayers on the Syrian side of the border, then crouching down behind ramparts that Israel constructed in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago. The number later dropped to about 50, with protesters waving Palestinian and Syrian flags.
Clashes also broke out between Palestinians and Israelis at the Qalandia crossing between Jerusalem and Ramallah in the West Bank on Sunday. At least six Palestinians were injured there, one seriously, by rubber bullets. Israeli forces also fired tear gas, while Palestinians threw stones.
The clashes come three weeks after similar demonstrations marking the 1948 birth of the Jewish state -- a day of mourning for Palestinians, more than 700,000 of whom were displaced from their homes during the fighting that followed. Those protests left at least 12 dead.
Leibovich accused Syria of trying to use the protests to create a diversion from the bloodshed that is taking place inside Syria, where the United Nations says a crackdown against anti-government protests has left more than 1,000 dead.
 There is no question about it, she said. The policemen, the armed Syrian forces are looking back and not doing anything. 
Demonstrators arrived in at least eight buses before the protest began, then came down from a hill known locally as Shouting Hill -- where people shout to family and friends on the other side of the border -- toward the ramparts Israeli forces constructed last month.
Leibovich said Israeli troops were better prepared to deal with the demonstrations than with the May 15 protests, beefing up forces along the frontier and making clear that we would not tolerate any infiltration into the Israeli side.

"Philosophers generally agree that we can be justified in believing 15bi and 15biii only empirically. Yet many believe that they are necessarily true. If they are necessarily true, that would mean that it’s false that we can be justified in believing necessary truths only a priori. But some philosophers think that 15bi and 15biii are not necessary truths and the relevant necessary truth that we can know a priori is that the essence of any type of matter is given by the basic elements of which it is composed. On this view, in the case of water and rubies, we discover empirically what those basic elements are and the propositions that state those discoveries are contingent. Philosophers who hold that 15bi and 15biii do express necessary truths usually think that there are descriptions that fix the reference of the terms, for example, for water, the description,
the stuff, whatever it is, that, in the actual world, has the properties of quenching thirst, putting out certain fires, falling from the clouds as rain, filling the lakes and rivers, etc.
While the meaning of “water” is given by this reference-fixing description, and can be known a priori, the essence of water must be discovered empirically. The meaning of natural kind terms does not give the essence of the kind directly in the way it does with “bachelor” and “vixen”.
One might think that 15a can be justified only empirically, but gemologists seem to think that it is conceptually necessary that rubies are red, that is, that the meaning of “ruby” requires that rubies be red. So given how gemologists use “ruby”, 15a is knowable a priori. The notion of a ruby seems to be a hybrid notion: its color is knowable a priori but its material essence as given in 15bi is knowable only empirically.
While it is widely believed that some necessary truths are capable of justification and can be known only empirically (e.g., “Water is H2O”), some contingent truths also seem justifiable, and knowable, a priori. Saul Kripke proposed that “the standard meter stick, S, in Paris is a meter long at 
t
0
” is such an example (Kripke 1972: 274–275). “The length of S in the actual world at 
t
0
” rigidly designates that length, that is, it refers to length L in every possible world. The reference of “one meter” is given by that reference-fixing description, so “one meter” rigidly designates L. However, “the length of S at 
t
0
” does not rigidly designate any particular length since at 
t
0
 in other possible worlds S will be longer or shorter than L. So the proposition that “S is a meter long at 
t
0

"The investigation considered farmers’ readiness to take part in crop insurance in the Dormaa municipality of the Bono Region, Ghana. Essential information from 167 respondents who were chosen through a multi-stage sampling method for the study was collected through a structured questionnaire. Elements influencing readiness to participate in crop protection by cocoa farmers was evaluated using probit regression model and lastly constraints of cocoa farmers were assessed utilizing Kendall’s coefficient of concordance. The study found that the average amount farmers were eager to pay was GH₵215.59 per year for crop insurance. Majority 96.7% of the respondents were eager to participate in crop insurance but 3.3% of the respondents were not willing to take part. The important factors influencing readiness to join crop insurance by the farmers were age, marital status, access to extension service and experience in cocoa farming. Again, the foremost constraint affecting the farmers was pests and diseases. The study therefore recommends that agricultural extension agents and other agricultural insurance stakeholders should sensitize crop farmers on the significance of crop insurance policy. Insurance companies ought to give crop insurance to farmers at moderate rates of GH¢ 215.59 per year to encourage their participation.
Key words: Crop insurance, cocoa, probit regression, Dormaa Municipal assembly, Ghana.
 INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is critical to the economy of each emerging nation including Ghana since it utilizes around 66% of the labour force in Ghana; both formal and casual. The agriculture subsector grew by 4.8% in 2018 contrasted with a development pace of 6.1% in 2017. Agriculture’s portion of gross domestic product dropped from  21.1% in 2017 to 19.7% in 2018. Crops are another major engagement in Ghana with a portion of 14.5% of gross domestic product (Ghana Statistical Service, 2019). Despite the fact that the contribution of farming to Ghana's Gross domestic product has dropped over the years, it continues to be a powerful force in the  economy  (ISSER, 2011). A fundamental profitable area and a significant source of export income for Ghana over the past years have been cocoa. Briesinger et al. (2011) showed the portion of cocoa in agrarian gross domestic product surge from 13.7% in 2000 to 2004 to 18.9% in 2005/2006. The momentous role of cocoa to Ghana's income in addition to the reality it helps as a key wellspring of work for many Ghanaian farmers implies its future against any unexpected conditions should be secured. This is on the grounds that any significant disaster in this sector will negatively affect both the macroeconomic and the microeconomic areas of the economy. Despite the fact that danger in the agricultural sector is inevitable, it can be managed.
Cocoa production differ markedly on yearly basis because of unpredicted climate conditions, pests and disease invasions and sporadic economic situations triggering harvests and prices to sway widely. Cocoa production ought to be given more consideration to enlarge Ghana's income and in addition to assist with settling the food security challenges in parts of the nation.
As per Oluyole and Sanusi (2009) prior investigations recognized some significant explanations behind differences in cocoa output which include low harvest, impulses of environment, extreme climate situations, infection occurrence, pest invasion, and regular dangers like heavy downpour, erosion and long dry seasons. High risks and uncertainties related with agricultural production has been ascribed to the decline in production of cocoa (Aderinola and Abdulkadri, 2007). This is due to the fact that similar to other crops, cocoa needs extensive uninterrupted and incessant interaction with the forces of nature. These threats and vulnerabilities are unpredicted and they are outside the capability of the farming households, subsequently, the farmers can just cope with them. Cocoa farmers incur huge losses on savings and income due to the losses suffered from these hazards and uncertainties. In the light of this, Ajakaiye and Adeyeye (2001) discovered that smallholder-farming households in many emerging nations of the world with no exception to Ghana are ensnared in the rancorous pattern of insufficiency.  This succession is portrayed by low output and low returns from the farm, occasioning in practically no sparing funds, necessary for the revolution of their farming expedition, accordingly adding to the low position conferred on farmers within the populace. Conversely, Quagrainie (2006) prescribed that insurance could be utilized to abate financial expenses of numerous hostile events, for example, deaths, accidents, burglary and weather damages. Insurance is defined as an agreement between two parties where one party called the insurer agrees to an exchange called premium to pay the other party a fixed measure of money in the event of sudden incident (Adams 1995).  As indicated by Sarris (2002), insurance warrants a base cost for an explicit amount over a determined duration for which the safety net   provider  pays  a  forthright premium.  Nevertheless, insurance affords the prospect for societies to substitute risk with known rate. Individuals procure insurance coverage hoping to receive a sum, anytime the policyholder encounters protection secured misfortune (Nimo et al., 2011). As indicated by Aidoo et al. (2014), a large portion of the insurance agencies in Ghana offer numerous protection plans (for example accident coverage, life and medical coverage, fire protection and burglary) apart from crop insurance scheme.","C2"
"Socialism is best defined in contrast with capitalism, as socialism has arisen both as a critical challenge to capitalism, and as a proposal for overcoming and replacing it. In the classical, Marxist definition (G.A. Cohen 2000a: ch.3; Fraser 2014: 57–9), capitalism involves certain relations of production. These comprise certain forms of control over the productive forces—the labor power that workers deploy in production and the means of production such as natural resources, tools, and spaces they employ to yield goods and services—and certain social patterns of economic interaction that typically correlate with that control. Capitalism displays the following constitutive features:
(i)	The bulk of the means of production is privately owned and controlled.
(ii)	People legally own their labor power. (Here capitalism differs from slavery and feudalism, under which systems some individuals are entitled to control, whether completely or partially, the labor power of others).
(iii)	Markets are the main mechanism allocating inputs and outputs of production and determining how societies’ productive surplus is used, including whether and how it is consumed or invested.
An additional feature that is typically present wherever (i)–(iii) hold, is that:
(iv)	There is a class division between capitalists and workers, involving specific relations (e.g., whether of bargaining, conflict, or subordination) between those classes, and shaping the labor market, the firm, and the broader political process.
The existence of wage labor is often seen by socialists as a necessary condition for a society to be counted as capitalist (Schweickart 2002 [2011: 23]). Typically, workers (unlike capitalists) must sell their labor power to make a living. They sell it to capitalists, who (unlike the workers) control the means of production. Capitalists typically subordinate workers in the production process, as capitalists have asymmetric decision-making power over what gets produced and how it gets produced. Capitalists also own the output of production and sell it in the market, and they control the predominant bulk of the flow of investment within the economy. The relation between capitalists and workers can involve cooperation, but also relations of conflict (e.g., regarding wages and working conditions). This more-or-less antagonistic power relationship between capitalists and workers plays out in a number of areas, within production itself, and in the broader political process, as in both the economic and political domains decisions are made about who does what, and who gets what.
There are possible economic systems that would present exceptions, in which (iv) does not hold even if (i), (ii) and (iii) all obtain. Examples here are a society of independent commodity producers or a property-owning democracy (in which individuals or groups of workers own firms). There is debate, however, as to how feasible—accessible and stable—these are in a modern economic environment (O’Neill 2012).
Another feature that is also typically seen as arising where (i)–(iii) hold is this:
(v)	Production is primarily oriented to capital accumulation (i.e., economic production is primarily oriented to profit rather than to the satisfaction of human needs). (G.A. Cohen 2000a; Roemer 2017).
In contrast to capitalism, socialism can be defined as a type of society in which, at a minimum, (i) is turned into (i*):
(i*)	The bulk of the means of production is under social, democratic control.
Changes with regard to features (ii), (iii), and (v) are hotly debated amongst socialists. Regarding (ii), socialists retain the view that workers should control their labor power, but many do not affirm the kind of absolute, libertarian property rights in labor power that would, e.g., prevent taxation or other forms of mandatory contribution to cater for the basic needs of others (G.A. Cohen 1995). Regarding (iii), there is a recent burgeoning literature on “market socialism”, which we discuss below, where proposals are advanced to create an economy that is socialist but nevertheless features extensive markets. Finally, regarding (v), although most socialists agree that, due to competitive pressures, capitalists are bound to seek profit maximization, some puzzle over whether when they do this, it is “greed and fear” and not the generation of resources to make others besides themselves better-off that is the dominant, more basic drive and hence the degree to which profit-maximization should be seen as a normatively troubling phenomenon. (See Steiner 2014, in contrast with G.A. Cohen 2009, discussing the case of capitalists amassing capital to give it away through charity.) Furthermore, some socialists argue that the search for profits in a market socialist economy is not inherently suspicious (Schweickart 2002 [2011]). Most socialists, however, tend to find the profit motive problematic.
An important point about this definition of socialism is that socialism is not equivalent to, and is arguably in conflict with, statism. (i*) involves expansion of social power—power based on the capacity to mobilize voluntary cooperation and collective action—as distinct from state power—power based on the control of rule-making and rule enforcing over a territory—as well of economic power—power based on the control of material resources (Wright 2010). If a state controls the economy but is not in turn democratically controlled by the individuals engaged in economic life, what we have is some form of statism, not socialism (see also Arnold n.d. in Other Internet Resources (OIR); Dardot & Laval 2014).

"Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was thrust into the national spotlight on two hot-button issues this week.
It had nothing to do with the cases involved -- same-sex marriage in Utah and a requirement for contraceptive coverage under Obamacare.
The two emergency appeals on New Year's Eve came her way because the cases originated in western areas of the country -- Colorado and Utah -- that fall under her jurisdiction for reviewing time-sensitive federal motions.
Sotomayor sought more information on an appeal from Utah to uphold its voter-approved ban on same-sex unions in the state.
But she made headlines on the politically charged case around the Affordable Care Act just as new rules were about to take effect.
Sotomayor issued an order that, for the moment, stayed a requirement under the sweeping health law for certain religiously affiliated groups to ensure that employees receive coverage for contraception at no cost.
The Denver-based organization that cares for elderly poor, the Little Sisters of the Poor, objects to complying with rules under the law that would guarantee it an exemption but, in theory, still require a third party to provide contraception insurance.
Ultimately, it believes authorizing a form that passes the ball to another entity still means contraception coverage for its employees and that, to the nuns, is objectionable on moral grounds. The Catholic Church opposes artificial contraception.
While Sotomayor's emergency injunction or any follow up to extend it or seek the opinion of her fellow justices for additional review may seem like a blow to the politically charged health care law, it is n't.
Nor does it convey any meaning about where Sotomayor, a liberal jurist, may stand on the larger issues raised in the appeal overall.
 She just placed a single case on hold. She did not overturn Obamacare, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.
Her decision late on Tuesday simply put the brakes on compliance for the Little Sisters of the Poor and enabled the Obama administration to file its arguments.
The Justice Department said on Friday the appeal lacked merit. The charity, it said, is eligible for an exemption and moreover, the entity that administers its insurance plans, the non-profit Christian Brothers Services, is also exempt under certain conditions in the Obamacare rules applying to religious institutions.
Toobin said Sotomayor acted based on her view of the law in holding up the rule in this case.
Sotomayor voted to uphold The Affordable Care Act in 2012 in a blockbuster Supreme Court ruling that gave Obama an enormous political victory.
Obamacare seeks to extend health coverage to millions of Americans without it and is the President's signature domestic achievement. It is relentlessly under attack from conservatives who have made numerous attempts to repeal or otherwise sink it, and is the focus of numerous legal challenges.

"﻿The inventor of a state-of-the-art computer-assisted autopsy system that is increasingly being used in European hospitals has claimed the technique could eventually mean there is no such thing as a 'perfect murder'. 
The method, called 'Virtopsy', is now being used at selected forensic medical institutes in Europe, having been pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich. Instead of reaching for the scalpel and making the Y-shaped incision in the chest with which a traditional autopsy begins, pathologists are now able to examine the corpse in 3-D via computer screens. 
Michael Thali, the Director of Zurich’s Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe, and one of the inventors of Virtopsy, said it had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations. “Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more as a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence,” he said. 
Virtopsies combine the images from high-powered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and surface scans of dead bodies. Combined, the devices are referred to as a 'Virtobot'. The technique allows the detection of injuries such as lesions and blows often undetectable during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer. 
“The Virtopsy has the potential to replace the autopsy one day,” Richard Dirndorfer, one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology, and a founder developer of Virtopsy, told the German science magazine PM . “I think we’ll see it happen gradually, just like DNA analysis gradually replaced blood group analysis,” he said. 
The computer imaging techniques allow doctors to gain in-depth insights into the deepest interiors of dead bodies. The method has already allowed the discovery of haemorrhages and fractures that were not picked up during conventional autopsies. The initial aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy. 
“It will enable forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently,” Dominic Wichmann, an internal medicine specialist at Hamburg’s University Hospital, told Spiegel. Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the development of the new method for themselves. 
The US forensic medical drama CSI has already twice featured Virtopsies. In one, the system was able to prove that a murder victim was killed by a bullet through the cheek; in another, a Virtopsy on a murdered man meant his wish to be cryogenically frozen could still go ahead as his body remained intact. 
The method has been under development for decades, with the scientists behind it first housed in an unheated laboratory on a university campus where they were considered a bit of a laughing stock. Later, a donation from a rich ophthalmologist enabled the project to take off. Even then it was initially rejected for its potential to undermine the traditional skills of forensic scientists and pathologists. But a new generation appears to be seeing it as less of a threat and rather as something that will complement and substantiate conventional methods and possibly even one day replace them, though probably not entirely. 
“In order to analyze the colour of the blood, the consistencies (of body fluids) or smells, we’ll need to keep on with the conventional cut,” said Lars Oesterhelweg, Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, which is using a version of the Virtopsy. 
He added that the new method was particularly helpful in re-examining cases where the cause of death was unclear. “It means that third opinions can be gathered, investigations can be re-examined and cases can be reopened,” he said. 
Scientists using the new method said that relatives of the dead, who are often reluctant for autopsies to be carried out because of the disfigurement they cause, were much keener on the non-invasive method.

"Federal officials said Thursday more needs to be done to warn rescuers of special dangers at the scene of small plane crashes.
Although firefighters are well versed about the dangers of burning fuel and sharp debris, they may not be aware that some aviation systems -- systems considered safety devices aloft -- become especially hazardous on the ground. Among the hazards: ejection seat rockets, airbag components, and explosive charges that deploy parachutes that can lower the entire aircraft to the ground.
 These explosive components, if they remain charged and are unknown to first responders and investigators, pose a high level of risk to those working in and around the aircraft wreckage, the National Transportation Safety Board said.
The safety board cited five incidents since 2001 in which first responders and accident investigators who responded to plane wrecks were evidently unaware of the hazard of explosive components.
 In some cases, they began performing rescue, fire suppression and accident investigation activities that might have inadvertently activated the explosive component, posing a great risk of injury, the safety board said. None resulted in fatalities or injuries to the responders.
In one incident -- the January 2012 fatal crash of an experimental jet near Rainbow City, Alabama -- a police officer became aware of the hidden dangers only after an NTSB investigator told him by phone not to allow the recovery of the pilot's remains until the pilot's ejection seat could be deactivated. In another incident, firefighters attempting to put out a blaze at a Cirrus SR22 crash took additional safety precautions after being told the plane had a BRS -- a solid-fuel rocket used to deploy the plane's parachute.
The NTSB is recommending that the Federal Aviation Administration take additional steps to address the safety issue. The FAA should require aircraft owners to disclose the presence of explosive safety devices when they register their aircraft every three years. The online registry is easily available to first responders, the NTSB said.
The FAA also should issue a safety bulletin to first responders, the board recommended.
The FAA said it will review the recommendations. We have collaborated with ballistic device manufacturers, airplane manufacturers, firefighting organizations and other first responder groups to develop training about the potential hazards at an accident scene and to ensure that warning markings meet the necessary guidelines, the FAA said in a statement.

"﻿Scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the well-documented phenomenon whereby people ‘remember’ events or experiences that have never happened. False memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law. 
Defendants have often been convicted of offences based on eyewitness testimony only to have their convictions later overturned when DNA, or some other corroborating evidence, is brought to bear. 
In order to study how these false memories might form in the human brain, Susumu Tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his team encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons. Memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements, including records of objects, space and time. These records, called engrams, are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them. 
According to Tonagawa, both false and genuinememories seem to rely on the same brain mechanisms. In their work, Tonagawa’s team used a technique known as optogenetics, which allows the fine control of individual brain cells. They engineered brain cells in the mouse hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be involved in forming memories, to express the gene for a protein called channelrhodopsin. When cells that contain channelrhodopsin are exposed to blue light, they become activated. The researchers also modified the hippocampus cells so that the channelrhodopsin protein would be produced in whichever brain cells the mouse was using to encode its memory engrams. 
In the experiment, Tonagawa’s team placed the mice in a chamber and allowed them to explore it. As they did so, relevant memory-encoding brain cells were producing the channelrhodopsin protein. The next day, the same mice were placed in a second chamber and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response. At the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first chamber. That way, the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber. 
In the final part of the experiment, the team placed the mice back in the first chamber. 
The mice froze, demonstrating a typical fear response, even though they had never been shocked while there. “We call this ‘incepting’ or implanting false memories in a mouse brain,” Tonagawa told Science. 
A similar process may occur when powerful false memories are created in humans. “Humans are very imaginative animals,” said Tonagawa. “Independent of what is happening around you in the outside world, humans constantly have internal activity in the brain. So, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good high-variance ongoing events. In other words, there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you.” 
He added: “Our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms. It is difficult for the false memory bearer to distinguish between them. We hope our future findings along this line will further alert legislatures and legal experts to how unreliable memory can be.” 
Chris French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London, is a leading researcher in false memories in people. He said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding their neural basis. 
“Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not, as is often assumed, work like a video camera, faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience. Instead, it is a reconstructive process, which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event, but also possibly including information from other sources.” He cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry – for example, false memories of childhood sexual abuse, or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse, abduction by aliens, or “past lives ”. “Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level,” said Professor French. 
Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford University, said the experiments were a “tour de force” but that it was important to put them into perspective. “Although the results seem to imply that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation (rather than the actual environment), this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most people’s idea of memory,” he said. Rather, he said, it was equivalent to implanting an association that perhaps someone cannot place but that makes them wary of a specific environment for no apparent reason. “It is unlikely that this kind of pairing could lead to the rich set of associations related to normal memories, although it is possible that, over time, such pairing could be integrated with other memories to construct a more elaborate false narrative.” 
The mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask ever more complex questions about memories in people. “Now that we can reactivate and change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy,” said Steve Ramirez, a colleague of Tonagawa’s at MIT. “Are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories? Can false memories be artificially created? What about false memories for more than just contexts – false memories for objects, food or other mice? These are the once seemingly sci-fi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab.” 
As the technology develops, said French, scientists need to think about its uses carefully. “Whatever means are used to implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures – the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated.”

"Two airplanes came too close to one another while attempting to land at a Detroit airport, a federal official said early Saturday, days after another close incident involving three jets at a Washington, D.C. airport.
A Delta flight from Phoenix was coming in to land Friday night at the Detroit Metro Airport as a small regional jet was trying to land, said Elizabeth Cory, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
The two planes were separated by approximately two horizontal miles. Standard separation distance is three miles, Cory said, noting that an investigation is under way.
CNN first learned of the incident from an alleged passenger who said he could see a regional jet below them from his cabin window.
 Air traffic control was aware that they had a situation where separation was less than they would like, Cory said.
Both pilots had visual contact with each other and neither plane was at risk of colliding with the other, she added.
Friday's incident in Detroit comes a day after federal authorities acknowledged that three U.S. Airways-operated jets at Reagan National Airport came closer than they should have because of an air traffic control miscommunication. 
Feds investigate 3 planes flying too close at DC-area airport
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon when air traffic controllers were making adjustments for landing and departing aircraft because of bad weather.
The Chautauqua Airlines flight came within 800 vertical feet and.82 nautical miles after takeoff of an arriving aircraft, identified as a Republic Airlines flight, authorities said.
The third plane involved was another Republic Airlines flight, which was taking off and came within 2.07 nautical miles and 800 vertical feet of the arriving flight.
 During the switchover of operations, miscommunication between the Tracon and the DCA tower led to a loss of the required separation between two regional jets departing from Runway 1 and a regional jet inbound for Runway 19, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
 Tracon, or terminal radar approach control, is a reference to a regional radar facility. DCA is the International Air Transport Association code for Reagan National Airport.
 At no point were the three aircraft on a head-to-head course, said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.
The FAA is investigating and plans to take appropriate action to address the miscommunication of Tuesday's incident.
 Such near misses and any operational errors are calls to action, Rep. John L. Mica, R-Florida, said after the Tuesday incident. I 'm asking our Aviation Subcommittee staff and FAA to thoroughly review what happened. 
Last year, an air traffic controller was suspended for failing to respond to two planes heading into National Airport after he fell asleep on the midnight shift.
The two planes landed without incident.

"Before we turn to assessment of ontological arguments, we need to get clear about what the proper intended goals of ontological arguments can be. Suppose we think of arguments as having advocates and targets: when an advocate presents an argument to a target, the goal of the advocate is to bring about some change in the target. What might be the targets of ontological arguments, and what might be the changes that advocates of these arguments aim to bring about in those targets?
Here are some proposals; no doubt the reader can think of others:
The targets might be atheists, and the goal might be to turn them into theists.
The targets might be agnostics, and the goal might be to turn them into theists.
The targets might be theists, and the goal might be to improve the doxastic position of theists.
The targets might be professional philosophers, and the goal might be to advance understanding of the consequences of adopting particular logical rules, or treating existence as a real predicate, or allowing definitions to have existential import, or the like.
The targets might be undergraduate philosophy students, and the goal might be to give them some sufficiently frustrating examples on which to cut their critical teeth.
In the coming discussion, it will be supposed that the targets are atheists and agnostics, and that the goal is to turn them into theists. Suppose that an advocate presents an ontological argument to a target. What conditions must that arguments satisfy if it is fit for its intended purpose? A plausible suggestion is that, minimally, it should make the targets recognise that they have good reason to accept the conclusion of the argument that they did not recognise that they have prior to the presentation of the argument. Adopting this plausible suggestion provides the following criterion: a successful ontological argument is one that should make atheists and agnostics recognise that they have good reason to believe that God exists that they did not recognise that they have prior to the presentation of the argument. Note that this criterion has a normative dimension: it adverts to what atheists and agnostics should do when presented with the argument.
There is an important discussion to be had about whether we should suppose that the targets of ontological arguments are atheists and agnostics, and that the goal is to turn them into theists. However, it is simply beyond the scope of this entry to pursue that discussion here.","C2"
"The terms “idealism” and “idealist” are by no means used only within philosophy; they are used in many everyday contexts as well. Optimists who believe that, in the long run, good will prevail are often called “idealists”. This is not because such people are thought to be devoted to a philosophical doctrine but because of their outlook on life generally; indeed, they may even be pitied, or perhaps envied, for displaying a naïve worldview and not being philosophically critical at all. Even within philosophy, the terms “idealism” and “idealist” are used in different ways, which often makes their meaning dependent on the context. However, independently of context one can distinguish between a descriptive (or classificatory) use of these terms and a polemical one, although sometimes these different uses occur together. Their descriptive use is best documented by paying attention to the large number of different “idealisms” that appear in philosophical textbooks and encyclopedias, ranging from metaphysical idealism through epistemological and aesthetic to moral or ethical idealism. Within these idealisms one can find further distinctions, such as those between subjective, objective and absolute idealism, and even more obscure characterizations such as speculative idealism and transcendental idealism. It is also remarkable that the term “idealism”, at least within philosophy, is often used in such a way that it gets its meaning through what is taken to be its opposite: as the meaningful use of the term “outside” depends on a contrast with something considered to be inside, so the meaning of the term “idealism” is often fixed by what is taken to be its opposite. Thus, an idealist is someone who is not a realist, not a materialist, not a dogmatist, not an empiricist, and so on. Given the fact that many also want to distinguish between realism, materialism, dogmatism, and empiricism, it is obvious that thinking of the meaning of “idealism” as determined by what it is meant to be opposed to leads to further complexity and gives rise to the impression that underlying such characterizations lies some polemical intent.
Within modern philosophy there are sometimes taken to be two fundamental conceptions of idealism:
something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality, and
although the existence of something independent of the mind is conceded, everything that we can know about this mind-independent “reality” is held to be so permeated by the creative, formative, or constructive activities of the mind (of some kind or other) that all claims to knowledge must be considered, in some sense, to be a form of self-knowledge.
Idealism in sense (1) has been called “metaphysical” or “ontological idealism”, while idealism in sense (2) has been called “formal” or “epistemological idealism”. The modern paradigm of idealism in sense (1) might be considered to be George Berkeley’s “immaterialism”, according to which all that exists are ideas and the minds, less than divine or divine, that have them. (Berkeley himself did not use the term “idealism”.) The fountainhead for idealism in sense (2) might be the position that Immanuel Kant asserted (if not clearly in the first edition of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) then in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783) and in the “Refutation of Idealism” in the second edition of the Critique) according to which idealism does “not concern the existence of things”, but asserts only that our “modes of representation” of them, above all space and time, are not “determinations that belong to things in themselves” but features of our own minds. Kant called his position “transcendental” and “critical” idealism, and it has also been called “formal” idealism. However, Kant’s position does not provide a clear model of idealism at all. While Kant himself claimed that his position combined “empirical realism” with “transcendental idealism”, that is, combined realism about external, spatio-temporal objects in ordinary life and science with the denial of the reality of space and time at the level of things as they are in themselves, it also insisted upon the reality of things as they are in themselves existing independently from our representations of them, thus denying their reducibility o representations or the minds that have them. In this way, Kant’s position actually combines the transcendental ideality of space and time with a kind of realism about the existence of things other than minds.
So instead of using Kant as any kind of model for epistemological idealism, in this entry we will distinguish between metaphysical and epistemological arguments for idealism understood as a metaphysical doctrine, namely that everything that exists is in some way mental. We thus agree with A.C. Ewing, who wrote in 1934 that all forms of idealism
have in common the view that there can be no physical objects existing apart from some experience, and this might perhaps be taken as the definition of idealism, provided that we regard thinking as part of experience and do not imply by “experience” passivity, and provided we include under experience not only human experience but the so-called “Absolute Experience” or the experience of a God such as Berkeley postulates. (Ewing 1934: 3)
in other words, while reducing all reality to some kind of perception is one form of idealism, it is not the only form—reality may be reduced to the mental on other conceptions of the latter. Thus Willem deVries’s more recent definition of idealism as the general theory that reduces reality to some form or other of the mental is just:
Roughly, the genus comprises theories that attribute ontological priority to the mental, especially the conceptual or ideational, over the non-mental. (deVries 2009: 211)
We also agree with Jeremy Dunham, Iain Hamilton Grant, and Sean Watson when they write that
the idealist, rather than being anti-realist, is in fact … a realist concerning elements more usually dismissed from reality. (Dunham, Grant, & Watson 2011: 4)
namely mind of some kind or other: the idealist denies the mind-independent reality of matter, but hardly denies the reality of mind (or, on their account, which goes back to Plato, Ideas or Forms as well as minds; we will not consider pre-modern forms of idealism in any detail). However, following Ewing (see his chapters II, IV–V, and VIII), we will distinguish metaphysical from epistemological arguments for idealism. Metaphysical arguments proceed by identifying some general constraints on existence and arguing that only minds of some sort or other satisfy such conditions; epistemological arguments work by identifying some conditions for knowledge and arguing that only objects that are in some sense or other mental can satisfy the conditions for being known. In particular, epistemological arguments for idealism assume that there is a necessary isomorphism between knowledge and its object that can obtain only if the object of knowledge is itself mental; we propose that this is the difference between epistemologically-motivated idealism and a more neutral position, which might be identified with philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap, W.V.O. Quine, and Donald Davidson, holding that of course we always know things from some point of view, but any “external” question about whether or not our point of view “corresponds” to independent reality is either meaningless or at least not answerable on theoretical grounds. It is in order to preserve the distinction between traditional idealism and positions such as the latter that we recommend retaining the claim that reality is in some way or other exclusively mental and thinking of epistemological arguments for idealism rather than epistemological idealism as such.
Of course these strategies can be combined by a single philosopher. Berkeley does so, and so does Kant in arguing for the transcendental idealist part of his complex position. Others separate them, for example F.H. Bradley and J.McT.E. McTaggart constructed metaphysical arguments for idealism, while Josiah Royce and Brand Blanshard offered epistemological arguments.
In what follows, we will concentrate mainly on the discussion of philosophical theories that either endorse or claim to endorse idealism on ontological and/or epistemological grounds. At some points in its complex history, however, above all in the social as well as philosophical movement that dominated British and American universities in the second half of the nineteenth century and through the first World War, idealism in either of its philosophical forms was indeed connected to idealism in the popular sense of progressive and optimistic social thought. This was true for figures such as Bradley and Royce and their predecessors and contemporaries such as Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet. There has recently been considerable interest in British or more generally Anglophone idealism as a movement in social philosophy, or even a social movement, but we will not pursue that here (see Mander 2011; Boucher & Vincent 2012; Mander [ed.] 2000; and Mander & Panagakou [eds.] 2016).

"The Three Amigos -- or, as they 're more formally known, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico -- announced an agreement Wednesday to work on a plan to streamline trade and travel, including border controls among the countries.
U.S. President Barack Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto agreed to streamline border controls to facilitate the movement of people through the establishment of a trusted traveler program.
They also spent a great deal of time during the North American LeadersSummit discussing efforts to broker a new trade agreement with Pacific nations, they said in a joint news conference after the summit in Toluca, Mexico.
Obama has called for fast-track trade authority from Congress for him to pursue the so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive free-trade zone.
But members of his own party, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have voiced firm opposition to such authority.
Republicans seized on Vice President Joe Biden's reported comments at last week's House Democratic retreat in Maryland. There, he was heard conceding the trade issue was quickly becoming a source of frustration within the party, especially among labor groups that are key to midterms next fall.
 The jobs they seem to care about most are Democrats in Congress -- not families across the country eager to join the ranks of the employed, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.
Senior Obama administration officials played down reports about Biden's comments as coming from second-hand accounts. But, they added, the White House remains firmly committed to its trade agenda.
 It would not be in the interest of the United States to put this on the back burner, one official said.
White House spokesman Jay Carney insists that differences among Democrats over trade issues date back several administrations.
 The differing opinions on these matters are not new, and the fact that there are differing opinions within both parties is not new, Carney said Tuesday.
Another area of friendly disagreement for the Three Amigos is over the Obama administration's handling of the Keystone XL pipeline.
Canadian officials have grown impatient with the lengthy approval process in the United States for the contested project, which would transport oil from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico.
While a recent State Department environmental impact study appeared to brighten prospects for approval, senior administration officials indicated Harper is not likely to receive the news many in his nation want to hear during the summit.
 I think what President Obama will do is explain to him where we are in the review of the Keystone pipeline, and indicate that we 'll, of course, let our Canadian friends know when we 've arrived at a decision, a senior administration official said.
The Keystone project has also divided Democrats, namely environmentalists who see the pipeline as a symbolic battle in the larger fight over efforts to deal with climate change.
While in Mexico, Obama faced another delicate balancing act over the issue of immigration reform.
The plight of undocumented immigrants in the United States, notably the substantial number of migrants who crossed the border from Mexico, is a major political issue south of the Rio Grande.
Latino special interest groups, a core Democratic Party constituency, have criticized the administration for its aggressive deportation policy as it struggles to find a long-term solution to the immigration issue.
Senior administration officials told reporters last week that Obama remains committed to comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers.
But that legislative priority has hit a roadblock in Congress, where Republican leaders have indicated there is little hope for a breakthrough this year before the midterms.
 With respect to immigration, I think President Peña Nieto has a very good understanding, frankly, of the state of play in the United States, a senior administration official said.

"Contemporary analytic philosophers, feminist and nonfeminist, can be characterized roughly as follows: they consider (some of) Frege, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein, and the Logical Positivists to be their intellectual ancestors; they tend to prize explicit argumentation and the literal, precise, and clear use of language; they often value the roles of philosophy of language, epistemology, and logic; and they typically view their stock of philosophical concepts, methods, and assumptions to be a) consistent with their Modern European heritage, and b) in contrast with methods originating in twentieth-century continental Europe, most recently those having names beginning with ‘post’: poststructuralism and postmodernism broadly conceived.
Of course, each strand of mid-twentieth-century, “classic” analytic philosophy has changed greatly. Many central dogmas have been undermined, and nonfeminists and feminists alike have “naturalized,” “socialized,” and otherwise modulated the earlier, more abstract and highly normative enterprises and doctrines. However, regardless of the extent of the evolution of “analytic philosophy,” the degree to which methodological boundaries are blurred today, and the fruitfulness of intersections among methods, a number of feminist and nonfeminist philosophers continue to think of themselves in the historical trajectory of analytic philosophy and find the tradition valuable. They claim the term ‘analytic philosopher’ for themselves, even if some others might find the term ‘post-analytic’ more appropriate.[2]","C2"
"﻿We may not yet be living in an age of flying cars, as predicted in the 1985 film Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. “It’s a very dynamic time,” said Robert Puentes, of the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program think- tank. “There’s a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.” 
As the average US commute lengthens and the country’s infrastructure ages badly, cities across the US are being forced to redefine what transportation is. Increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traffic congestion aren’t enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a city’s larger sustainability efforts. 
Big US cities like Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. “The most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,” Puentes said. “You can’t be a global competitive city if you don’t have a robust transportation network.” 
Here are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. 
The rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft – essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button – and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traffic data to find the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traffic moves through a city. Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert on transportation technology. 
According to a recent study from the UCLA’s Institute of Transportation Studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials – individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s – compared to previous generations. According to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives. 
Meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traffic thanks to Waze. Experts say the traffic app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. This has angered residents, who claim the increased traffic on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life. 
This trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. Currently, a traffic light can detect when a car is approaching but that’s about it. Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traffic control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling. 
Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. However, the partial automation of cars is already underway. Alexandre Bayen of the University of California expects automation will progress in stages: first, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single file. 
The idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the efficiency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. It can also help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion and allow more people access to cars. But, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old. 
To see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380. 
As the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling. 
Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. If their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. “We’re going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,” she said. 
When considering the future of transportation, it’s also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. Technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips – say, virtual meetings or telecommuting – could also have a big impact on transportation. 
There was a time when the idea of a flying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated – and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.”

"﻿Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100,000 people took to the streets nationwide to express their frustration at heavy-handed policing, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup. 
The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasilia, Belem, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully, but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses. 
The large turnout and geographic spread marked a rapid escalation after previous, smaller protests against bus price increases led to complaints that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings. 
Coinciding with the start of the Confederations Cup – a World Cup test event – the rallies brought together a wide coalition of people frustrated with the escalating costs and persistently poor quality of public services, lavish investment in international sporting events, low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption. 
While the vast majority of demonstrations in Rio were peaceful, several police were injured in clashes at the city’s legislative assembly, at least one car was overturned and burned, and windows were smashed in the offices of banks and notary offices. 
The unrest escalated during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside the legislative assembly, smashed the building’s windows and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming “Revolution”, “Down with Paes, down with Cabral [the mayor and state governor]” and “Hate police”. Police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more – the Guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm. 
The causes pursued by the protesters varied widely. “We are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us,” said Oscar José Santos, a 19 year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the Rocinha favela. 
“I’m an architect but I have been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country,” said Nadia al Husin, holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education. 
At a far smaller rally in Brasilia, demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress. Several climbed onto the roof. 
In Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti. 
In Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere. 
In São Paulo, which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence, large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully. 
Reflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests, some in São Paulo – where numbers were estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000 – carried banners declaring “We come from Facebook”. 
Most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. “My generation has never experienced this,” said Thiago Firbida, a student. “Since the dictatorship, Brazilians never bothered to take over the streets. They did not believe they had a reason to. But now Brazil is once again in crisis, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.” 
Comparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests. 
Brazil’s demonstrations are being referred to as the “vinegar revolution” (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas), as well as the “20-cent revolution” (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport). 
Some said the protests felt un-Brazilian but liberating. “Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes – they enjoy partying rather than protesting – but something is changing,” said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor. 
Following widespread news coverage of the costs of new and refurbished stadiums, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests. Before the opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as the sound of shots – perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas – was heard. 
Another protest march, near Rio’s Maracana Stadium, was met with a similarly heavy police response. 
Most of the rallies appeared to start peacefully until they confronted the security forces, who are largely organized at a regional level. President Dilma Rousseff condones the protests, according to her aides. “The president believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy, and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate,” said Helena Chagas of the president’s office. 
However, the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup. With the economy in bad shape and social unrest on the rise, she faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election.

"Hedge funds are turning bullish on oil once again, betting the pandemic and investors’ environmental focus has severely damaged companies’ ability to ramp up production.
The view is a reversal for hedge funds, which shorted the oil sector in the lead-up to global shutdowns, landing energy focused hedge funds gains of 26.8% in 2020, according to data from eVestment. By virtue of their fast-moving strategies, hedge funds are quick to spot new trends.
Global oil benchmark Brent has jumped 59% since early November when news of successful vaccines emerged, after COVID-19 travel curbs and lockdowns last year hammered fuel demand and collapsed oil prices. Last week it hit pre-pandemic levels close to $60 a barrel.
U.S. crude has climbed 54% to around $57 per barrel during the same period.
“By the summer, the vaccine should be widely provided and just in time for summer travel and I think things are going to go gangbusters,” said David D. Tawil, co-founder at New York-based event-driven hedge fund, Maglan Capital, and interim CEO of Centaurus Energy.
Tawil predicted prices of $70 to $80 a barrel for Brent by the end of 2021 and is investing long independent oil and gas producers.
Hedge funds’ bullish bets come despite the International Energy Agency warning in January a spike in new coronavirus cases will hamper oil demand this year, and a slow economic recovery would delay a full rebound in world energy demand to 2025.
Normally, oil producers would ramp up production as prices increase, but a move by environmentally focused investors from fossil fuels to renewables and caution by lenders leaves them hard-pressed to respond, hedge funds and other investors say.
The pace of output recovery in the United States, the world’s No. 1 oil producer, is forecast to be slow and will not top its 2019 record of 12.25 million barrels per day (bpd) until 2023. Production in 2020 tumbled 6.4% to 11.47 million bpd.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has also revised down demand growth, however, still expects output cuts to keep the market in deficit throughout 2021.
Global crude and condensate production was down 8% in December from February 2020, prior to the pandemic’s spread accelerating, according to Rystad Energy.
North America’s output was down 9.5% and Europe’s production declined just 1% over the same time period.
U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and declining oilfields in Mexico have kept oil output from Latin America sluggish.
Some banks are forecasting the United States, which leads with the number of COVID-19 cases, to reach herd immunity by July, which would greatly stimulate oil demand, said Jean-Louis Le Mee, head of London-based hedge fund Westbeck Capital Management, which is long a mix of oil futures and equities.
“Oil companies, for the first time in a long time, are likely to make a big comeback,” he said. “We have all the ingredients for an extraordinary bull market in oil for the next few years.”
In the United States, hedge funds increased their allocation to Exxon Mobil Corp by 21,314 shares in the third quarter, the most recent U.S. filings compiled by Symmetric.io showed.
Hedge funds added another 9,070 shares of U.S. majors ConocoPhillips and 4,144 to Chevron Corp over the same time period.
Elsewhere, shorting activity in BP PLC fell by 16 million shares on Feb. 4 but increased slightly in European oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc by 1.9 million shares, data from FIS’ Astec Analytics showed.
Some investors remain skeptical on Canadian oil companies, among the world’s most carbon-intensive producers, though they are bouncing back faster from the pandemic than the United States.
Current short positions rose in 10 out of 14 Canadian oil companies in the Toronto energy index during the second two weeks of January, according to filings reviewed by Reuters.
U.S. shale production will not quickly rebound, given the capital required and debt producers are carrying, lending oil prices support, said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Calgary-based Canoe Financial LP.
North America’s oilfield services sector, which producers rely on to drill new wells, has been decimated, he said.
“They’re decapitated from being able to grow,” Tahmazian said. “The supply side is broken.”","C2"
"This study investigated the economic effects of malaria on cocoa farmers in Ondo State, Nigeria using the ordinary least square regression technique. Descriptive statistics were used to identify strategies to reduce malaria infection among cocoa farmers. The sample frame for the study was derived from secondary data obtained from records of Ondo State Ministry of Health on registered cocoa farmers who had malaria during the production season in 2015. Multi-stage, systematic and purposive samplings were used to select 180 respondents for the study. Some of the variables measured include: annual income of farmers, direct cost of malaria treatment, number of days of incapacitation and additional labour cost incurred by the farmers during periods of incapacitation. Results from the study showed that the mean annual income estimate was ₦524,096. It was revealed that the cost of malaria treatment and additional labour cost incurred had  a significant effect on the income of the farmers, however; the number of days of incapacitation had no significant effect on the income of cocoa farmers.
Key words: Malaria, income, ordinary least squares regression and cocoa.
 INTRODUCTION
Economic growth and development are achievable in any nation with a viable agricultural sector. Most developed nations of the world are characterized by technology-driven farm production activities. This has enhanced self-sufficiency in feeding their populace. In developing countries, on the other hand, farm production activities depend largely on people in the rural areas using manual labour. Owing to the physical nature of farming activities, the health of farmers could be adversely affected by diseases including malaria if they have little or no medical attention. Medical issues have been observed to impact negatively on agricultural productivity in Nigeria and malaria has been a major contributor to ill health in Africa (Breman et al., 2006). According to Kwadwo et al. (2009), human activities, including agriculture has been recognized as one of the reasons for increased intensity of malaria around the world, because it supports the breeding of mosquitoes that carries the parasite. Mohammed et al. (2018) posited that a greater percentage of small-scale farmers in Nigeria leave (sic) in  the rural areas. A typical rural village in the country is characterized with an indecent environment, poor housing, bushy surroundings, and exposed water in wells and gutters. These aforementioned characteristics are reproducing grounds for mosquitoes that in turn inject malaria parasites on the rural people. Malaria as a life-threatening disease is caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes (World Health Organization, 2016).
Despite being a preventable and treatable disease, malaria accounts for about 212 million of cases and 429,000 deaths globally in 2015 alone (World Health Organization, 2016). More than 80% of the estimated malaria deaths in 2012 occurred in just 17 countries, and 80% of cases occur in 18 countries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria together accounting for 40% of the estimated global total (World Health Organization, 2012; National Population Commission et al., 2012).
The recurrent nature of malaria and a coincidence of malaria peak season with harvesting season accentuated the burden for the rural poor who are already dependent on subsistence farming and with limited coping options (Adhanom et al., 2006; Chuma et al., 2006). Thus, malaria is expected to affect the income of farmers in the farming season. Evidence on the economic burden of malaria is important for prioritization of prevention and treatment service at the national and sub-national levels and facilitates better resource allocation in the health care system (McIntyre et al., 2006; Larg and Moss, 2011). Comparing evidence of economic burden of malaria from different settings, time periods, patient groups, and epidemiological profiles is challenging (Drummond, 2015), hence traditionally, studies that have attempted to estimate the economic burden of malaria have focused on the private and non-private medical costs associated with the disease, as well as some measure of the income that is forgone as a result of malaria morbidity and mortality (Jefferey and Pia, 2002).
There are no empirical evidence to investigate the effect of malaria on income of cocoa farmers, although there have been studies that addressed malaria effects on crop farmers in general. There have also been studies that focused on how sickness generally affect cocoa farmers; however, there is no study that focused on the economic effects of malaria on cocoa farmers. An intensified and increased commitment and financial allocation for malaria prevention and control measures have reduced the burden of malaria mortality rate among under-five children by 29% globally within five years since 2010 (World Health Organization, 2016), hence a little insight into the challenges posed by malaria on cocoa farmers will help policy makers especially non-governmental organizations interested in boosting cocoa exportation among developing countries, in formulating the  right  policies  aimed  at  reducing  malaria  incidence among cocoa farmers.","C2"
"TAccording to Kant, what is singular about motivation by duty is that it consists of bare respect for the moral law. What naturally comes to mind is this: Duties are rules or laws of some sort combined with some sort of felt constraint or incentive on our choices, whether from external coercion by others or from our own powers of reason. For instance, the bylaws of a club lay down duties for its officers and enforce them with sanctions. City and state laws establish the duties of citizens and enforce them with coercive legal power. Thus, if we do something because it is our “civic” duty, or our duty “as a boy scout” or “a good American,” our motivation is respect for the code that makes it our duty. Thinking we are duty bound is simply respecting, as such, certain laws pertaining to us.
However intuitive, this cannot be all of Kant’s meaning. For one thing, as with the Jim Crow laws of the old South and the Nuremberg laws of Nazi Germany, the laws to which these types of “actions from duty” conform may be morally despicable. Respect for such laws could hardly be thought valuable. For another, our motive in conforming our actions to civic and other laws is rarely unconditional respect. We also have an eye toward doing our part in maintaining civil or social order, toward punishments or loss of standing and reputation in violating such laws, and other outcomes of lawful behavior. Indeed, we respect these laws to the degree, but only to the degree, that they do not violate values, laws or principles we hold more dear. Yet Kant thinks that, in acting from duty, we are not at all motivated by a prospective outcome or some other extrinsic feature of our conduct except insofar as these are requirements of duty itself. We are motivated by the mere conformity of our will to law as such.
To act out of respect for the moral law, in Kant’s view, is to be moved to act by a recognition that the moral law is a supremely authoritative standard that binds us and to experience a kind of feeling, which is akin to awe and fear, when we acknowledge the moral law as the source of moral requirements. Human persons inevitably have respect for the moral law even though we are not always moved by it and even though we do not always comply with the moral standards that we nonetheless recognize as authoritative.
Kant’s account of the content of moral requirements and the nature of moral reasoning is based on his analysis of the unique force moral considerations have as reasons to act. The force of moral requirements as reasons is that we cannot ignore them no matter how circumstances might conspire against any other consideration. Basic moral requirements retain their reason-giving force under any circumstance, they have universal validity. So, whatever else may be said of basic moral requirements, their content is universal. Only a universal law could be the content of a requirement that has the reason-giving force of morality. This brings Kant to a preliminary formulation of the CI: “I ought never to act except in such a way that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law” (G 4:402). This is the principle which motivates a good will, and which Kant holds to be the fundamental principle of all of morality.

"Why should philosophy be interested in what would seem to be a purely linguistic notion? Because, especially in the first half of the Twentieth Century, many philosophers thought it could perform crucial epistemological work, providing an account, first, of our apparently a priori knowledge of mathematics, and then—with a little help from British empiricism—of our understanding of claims about the spatio-temporal world as well. Indeed, “conceptual analysis” soon came to constitute the very way particularly Anglophone philosophers characterized their work.
Many additionally thought it would perform the metaphysical work of explaining the truth and necessity of mathematics, showing not only how it is we could know about these topics independently of experience, but how they could be true in this and all possible worlds. This latter ambition was sometimes not distinguished from the former one, although it is no longer shared by most philosophers still interested in the analytic. Indeed, many have wondered how could any sentence be true, much less necessary, “by virtue of meaning alone,” since surely the truth of any sentence depends upon the world being the way the sentence represents it as being. Recall that Frege’s ambition was to reduce mathematics to logic by showing how, substituting synonyms for synonyms, every mathematical truth could be shown to be a logical one. He didn’t go on to claim (although some later philosophers did) that the logical truths themselves were true by virtue of meaning alone. Thus, “Bachelors are unmarried” might be shown to be analytic by substituting “unmarried males” for “bachelors” and converting it thereby to the logical truth “Unmarried males are unmarried.” But what makes this latter true? As Devitt (1996) pointed out:[1]
It is true partly in virtue of what it means and partly in virtue of the way the world is, in virtue of all unmarrieds being unmarried. … [Such sentences] are true in virtue of meaning given the logical truths (1996, p. 22)
In view of this point, in the remainder of this entry we will focus primarily on the epistemological project.","C2"
"In mathematics, the Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor's series are named after Brook Taylor who introduced them in 1715.
If zero is the point where the derivatives are considered, a Taylor series is also called a Maclaurin series, after Colin Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.
The partial sum formed by the n first terms of a Taylor series is a polynomial of degree n that is called the nth Taylor polynomial of the function. Taylor polynomials are approximations of a function, which become generally better as n increases. Taylor's theorem gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such approximations. If the Taylor series of a function is convergent, its sum is the limit of the infinite sequence of the Taylor polynomials. A function may differ from the sum of its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series is convergent. A function is analytic at a point x if it is equal to the sum of its Taylor series in some open interval (or open disk in the complex plane) containing x. This implies that the function is analytic at every point of the interval (or disk).
The Greek philosopher Zeno considered the problem of summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility;[2] the result was Zeno's paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes, as it had been prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes's method of exhaustion that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result.[3] Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later.[4]
In the 14th century, the earliest examples of the use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama.[5][6] Though no record of his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest that he found a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.
In the 17th century, James Gregory also worked in this area and published several Maclaurin series. It was not until 1715 however that a general method for constructing these series for all functions for which they exist was finally provided by Brook Taylor,[7] after whom the series are now named.
The Maclaurin series was named after Colin Maclaurin, a professor in Edinburgh, who published the special case of the Taylor result in the 18th century.","C2"
"﻿A long time ago, cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far, far away: one where imperial cruisers battled rebel fighters, where droids rubbed circuits with Wookiees and where a spaceship called the Millennium Falcon could make the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. That was 1977 but, in 2015, as the franchise approaches its seventh big-screen instalment, interest in Star Wars shows no sign of abating – now, there is news of a new film about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader. “Countless fans around the world are in a constant state of vigilance waiting for the release of new poster art, new trailers and other information,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box-office monitor Rentrak. “It’s hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could evoke such a level of passion, enthusiasm and excitement.” 
The latest Star Wars mania dates from the Hollywood studio Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm from the film’s creator, George Lucas, in 2012; the $4bn acquisition was accompanied by an announcement of three more sequential “episodes” – VII, VIII and IX – plus then unspecified plans for spin-off movies and “stand-alones” to fill the gaps in the release schedule. Details of the second spin-off have now been made public: an “origins story” about Han Solo, the intergalactic smuggler played by Harrison Ford in the first three films, which is scheduled to be released in May 2018. 
It will follow the release in December 2015 of Episode VII, directed by JJ Abrams and titled Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the unnamed Episode VIII due out in 2017 and the already announced spin-off, Rogue One, which will arrive in cinemas in 2016. 
That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key plot element of the first film in 1977. Levels of interest in the rumour that Rogue One will also feature the reappearance of Darth Vader, the black-clad villain of the original series, only confirmed the power of Star Wars nostalgia. 
In creating a multi-stranded, multi-character cinema “universe” around Star Wars, Lucasfilm-Disney are taking their cue from the phenomenally successful series of films produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also acquired, in 2009.  
Disney has brought a whole new level of marketing savvy to an already popular product: Dergarabedian cites the decision to make all six existing Star Wars films available on streaming services as “a brilliant way to build the anticipation for the new film and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans”. 
Whether it needs reinvigorating is questionable. The level of enthusiasm that has surrounded Star Wars for at least the last two decades is evidenced by what has become known as the “Expanded Universe”: the plethora of novels, comic books, video games and merchandising that Lucasfilm has created or licensed over the years. 
This extra material began emerging as far back as 1978 but was given a massive kick by the mushrooming of the internet in the 1990s. Role-play and fan participation show no sign of slowing: in the UK, event-cinema brand Secret Cinema have found considerable commercial success with their live staging of The Empire Strikes Back. 
Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this “shared universe” of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps Star Wars in pole position among film franchises. “The great thing about the original films was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers,” he said. 
“For years, people have been wondering how the different strands would play out. This new film, because it’s going back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, looks as though it will reconnect with the original Star Wars in a way that the prequels failed to.” 
Rosser is referring to the three films Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005 – The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith – which chronicled the life of Luke Skywalker’s father, Anakin, who transforms into Darth Vader. Despite being greeted with less-than-stellar reviews, the prequels took $2.5bn at the worldwide box office, shortly after the release of restored and augmented “special editions” of the first trilogy had netted $469m in 1997. 
“It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money,” said Rosser. 
In a film business where branding is all and a successful franchise the answer to everybody’s prayers, is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema for its own sake? 
Rosser thinks not. “They are desperate to ensure the longevity of the franchise and make sure the quality is kept up. They are also trying to bring people into the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment. But you don’t want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone so I don’t think it’s going to run out of steam any time soon.” 
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian is anticipating massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015. “We are certainly looking at a record opening for December and it should go on to make at least a billion dollars worldwide. Truly, Star Wars is the ultimate movie brand.”

"﻿The threatened extinction of the tiger in India, the perilous existence of the orangutan in Indonesia, the plight of the panda: these are wildlife emergencies with which we have become familiar. They are well-loved animals that no one wants to see disappear. But, now, scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home, with the threat to creatures such as ladybirds posing the gravest danger to biodiversity. 
Climate change, declining numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean a growing number of scientists now declare us to be in the Anthropocene – the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems. 
WWF’s Living Planet Index (LPI) 2014 seemed to confirm that grim picture, with statistics on the world’s wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across countless species. The LPI showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52% over four decades. Biodiversity loss has now reached “critical levels ”. Some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses, with freshwater species declining by 76% over the same period. 
But it’s the creatures that provide the most “natural capital” or “ecosystem services” that are getting many scientists really worried. Three quarters of the world’s food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies. Never mind how cute a panda is or how stunning a tiger – it’s worms that are grinding up our waste and taking it deep into the soil to turn into nutrients, and bats that are catching mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates down. A study in North America has valued the loss of pestcontrol from ongoing bat declines at more than $22bn in lost agricultural productivity. 
“It’s the loss of the common species that will impact on people, not so much the rarer creatures because, by the very nature of their rarity, we’re not reliant on them in such an obvious way,” said Dr Nick Isaac, a macroecologist at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Oxfordshire. He says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that Britain’s insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates, with “serious consequences for humanity”. “The really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that it’s not just about the numbers of species going extinct, but the actual numbers in a population; that’s the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding,” he says. 
He pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36% of all birds, mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction. In many parts of the world, wild- animal food sources are a critical part of the diet, particularly for the poor. 
The blame, most agree, sits with unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems, creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought. But, this time, it’s not just the “big, cuddly mammals” we have to worry about losing but the smaller, less visible creatures upon which we depend – insects, creepy- crawlies and even worms. They might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all. “We are going to feel the impact of those losses. With the UK species, the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates. It’s not as simplistic as 'fish die and people starve' – it’s more complex,” said Isaac. 
Humans, said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013, are a “plague on earth”, but WWF claims there is still time to stop the rot. Its UK Chief Executive, David Nussbaum, said: “The scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wake-up call for us all. We all – politicians, business and people – have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure we protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature. 
“Humans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow, harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock, pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb,” he said.

"It's getting difficult, even for a defense attorney, to keep track of the allegations against Bill Cosby. Recently, the embattled comedian's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15.
Huth claims she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot. A week later Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit states that Cosby took her to the Playboy Mansion. At the mansion, Cosby allegedly forced her to perform a sex act on him.
Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night. They have filed a demurrer , which challenges the legal sufficiency of the claims or the complaint itself. A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
In the court of public opinion, many have already concluded that there is something to these mounting accusations. On the other hand, perhaps the jury of public sentiment will be swayed by Camille Cosby's retort today that media coverage of her husband is comparable to the Rolling Stone UVA alleged gang rape article. Verdicts in the court of public opinion are mercurial and rarely restrained by the same strictures applied by the actual judiciary.
In real court, however, the rules are different. Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules. If they knew it was impossible to comply with the rules, then the attorneys knew when they filed the complaint that it was fatally defective. Irrespective of the breakdown in communication between lawyer and client, this complaint should probably be dismissed.
Cosby breaks his silence
Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations are laws that set the maximum period during which one can wait before filing a lawsuit, and they vary depending on the state and type of case. By definition, they deny access to a substantive claim for a purely procedural reason.
While limitations periods are arbitrary, the public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law too. It makes sense that you should not have to be hauled into court tomorrow for a fender bender you got into with your 1977 AMC Gremlin... in 1977.
But there's a big difference between a minor traffic accident and sexual assault cases. Limitations periods are more controversial in sexual assault cases because complainants -- sometimes children -- will repress memories, or fear coming forward. Indeed, the abject terror or trauma caused by an assailant may be why the victim lets the limitations period run.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse. Under California law, the only way that an alleged victim of childhood sexual abuse is able to bring an otherwise time-barred claim is to allege that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered within the last three years.
Since this constitutes a potentially limitless limitations period, the rule has two major safeguards built into it to avoid meritless claims and protect the rights of would-be defendants.
First, when asserting claims based on alleged childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit. Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack. The public policy behind this rule is sound: taking a plaintiff's word that they repressed a memory that caused them to miss the statute of limitations invites uncertainty and fraud.
Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit. However, Cosby's lawyers point out she attempted to sell this story to the tabloids more than nine years ago. Even if Huth is allowed to file these certificates, what medical professional will certify her lost memory until three years ago of an event... that she tried to profit from by selling word of it some years before that ?
Second, the rule provides some protection to would-be defendants and their privacy. After all, requiring some initial scientific proof of a repressed memory and injury is a good idea, but a medical provider can not really provide any assurances about the identity of an assailant -- other than relying upon the patient's words.
That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission. Huth could have complied with this rule by naming Cosby as John Doe, or some anonymous designation. She did n't. Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.
You might think this is just a clerical gaffe that could be remedied, as many are, by filing an amended complaint -LRB- as she eventually did -RRB-. Cosby's attorneys point out that this is no mere mistake that can be fixed. Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there. As Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and many at Sony have learned, you ca n't un-ring the privacy bell -- once your name -LRB- or image -RRB- is out there, it's out there.
Childhood sexual abuse is a detestable crime, and the injuries last a lifetime. Recognizing this, modern jurisdictions have amended the normally inflexible statutes of limitations to allow victims their day in court, while seeking to protect would-be defendants from meritless claims. Huth's case illustrates that these rules are not merely procedural. Violating these protective rules threatens the public perception of other legitimate victims who want their day in court.
The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby. That's how that court operates -- unfettered by the nuisances of the rules of procedure or evidence. But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.

"﻿The mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to US researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives. 
Armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at Stanford University worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. But that was not all. 
The same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. One man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. Other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis. 
The results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as Google, Yelp and Facebook. The value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. As Stewart Baker, the former general counsel at the US National Security Agency (NSA), put it in the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s revelations: “Metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.” 
Patrick Mutchler, a computer security researcher at Stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “That makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. Now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said. 
For the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an Android app. The app also received information from their Facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. In all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts. 
Analysts who logged into the NSA’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. A call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. From that phone to another was two hops. And so on. The records available to analysts stretched back for five years. The collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most. 
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, Jonathan Mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. Through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. The same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. When these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. In this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. Mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their Facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college. 
The scientists next delved into more personal territory. Using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. Once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report. 
For the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. They gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. From these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives. 
The metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. Another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semi- automatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. The metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant. 
“All of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said Mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “Large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the NSA’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “To strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.” 
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “With the right analytics running over nation- scale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. We always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”

"In hermeneutics, interpretive experience is typically clarified in reference to understanding. In this context, when we say that we understand, what we mean is that we have really gotten at something through an attempt at interpretation; and, when we say we do not understand, we mean that we have not really gotten anywhere at all with our interpretation. For this reason, understanding can be described as a ‘success’ of interpretation (even if, since Heidegger, understanding is more commonly described as a fulfillment, realization, or enactment). In hermeneutics, such success of understanding is not measured by norms and methods typical of the modern natural sciences and quantitative social sciences, such as whether our understanding derives from a repeatable experiment, nor by norms typical of much of modern philosophy, such as whether our understanding has indubitable epistemic foundations.
Now, philosophers associated with hermeneutics describe the success of understanding in a number of manners. However else the success of understanding is described, though, it is typically also described as edifying or educative. Indeed, Hans-Georg Gadamer, the philosopher perhaps most closely associated with hermeneutics in our times, closely connects interpretive experience with education. By education, he has in mind the concept of formation (Bildung) that had been developed in Weimar classicism and that continued to influence nineteenth-century romanticism and historicism in Germany (Truth and Method, Part I.1).[1] Education, as formation, involves more than the acquisition of expertise, knowledge, or information; it concerns the enlargement of our person though formal instruction, especially in the arts and humanities, as well as through extensive and variegated experience. Accordingly, the success of understanding is educative in that we learn from our interpretive experience, perhaps not only about a matter, but thereby also about ourselves, the world, and others.
That the success of understanding is educative in this manner can be clarified by an example, say, in reading a text such as Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War. When we say that we understand this text, we mean that our attempts to interpret it (whether rigorously, as in scholarship, or more casually, as in evening reading) have gotten at something, perhaps: that in politics, prudent reasoning is not always persuasive enough to stem the tide of war. Certainly, we have not arrived at this understanding in result of repeatable scientific experiment or based on an indubitable epistemic foundation. But it is not for this reason any less educative. In this understanding, we have come to something that we can agree or disagree with, something that in any case expands or changes our views about the role of reason in politics (and no doubt then also of public discourse and the causes of war), and, finally, something that can also teach us something about ourselves and the world in which we find ourselves.","C2"
"Deep learning is at the heart of the current rise of artificial intelligence. In the field of computer
vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and
security. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human
capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks
in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images,
such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models.
Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently
led to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on
adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks,
analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial
attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial
attacks in the real-world scenarios. Finally, drawing on the reviewed literature, we provide a broader outlook
of this research direction.

I. INTRODUCTION
Deep Learning [1] is providing major breakthroughs in solving the problems that have withstood many attempts of
machine learning and artificial intelligence community in
the past. As a result, it is currently being used to decipher
hard scientific problems at an unprecedented scale, e.g. in
reconstruction of brain circuits [2]; analysis of mutations in
DNA [3]; prediction of structure-activity of potential drug
molecules [4], and analyzing the particle accelerator data [5]
[6]. Deep neural networks have also become the preferred
choice to solve many challenging tasks in speech recognition [7] and natural language understanding [8].
In the field of Computer Vision, deep learning became the
center of attention after Krizhevsky et al. [9] demonstrated the
impressive performance of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) [10] based model on a very challenging large-scale
visual recognition task [11] in 2012. A significant credit for
the current popularity of deep learning can also be attributed
to this seminal work. Since 2012, the Computer Vision community has made numerous valuable contributions to deep
learning research, enabling it to provide solutions for the
problems encountered in medical science [21] to mobile
applications [179]. The recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the form of tabula-rasa learning of AlphaGo
Zero [14] also owes a fair share to deep Residual Networks
(ResNets) [15] that were originally proposed for the task of
image recognition.
With the continuous improvements of deep neural network
models [15], [144], [166]; open access to efficient deep learning software libraries [175]–[177]; and easy availability of
hardware required to train complex models, deep learning
is fast achieving the maturity to enter into safety and security critical applications, e.g. self driving cars [12], [180],
surveillance [13], maleware detection [34], [107], drones and
robotics [155], [178], and voice command recognition [7].
With the recent real-world developments like facial recognition ATM [181] and Face ID security on mobile phones [182],
it is apparent that deep learning solutions, especially those
originating from Computer Vision problems are about to play
a major role in our day-to-day lives.","C2"
"Many philosophers recognize a distinction between two kinds of mental events. (A) The first goes by many names, e.g., phenomenal experiences, occurrences of qualitative consciousness, the what-it-is-like of experience, qualia. Pains, afterimages, and tastes can serve as examples. (B) Mental events of the second kind are occurrent propositional attitudes, e.g., (occurrent) beliefs and desires. Arguments about epiphenomenalism may concern either type of mental event, and it should not be assumed that an argument given for one type can be rephrased without loss for the other. The two types can often be connected, however, through beliefs that one has one’s experiences. Thus, if it is held that pains have no physical effects, then one must say either (i) pains do not cause beliefs that one is in pain, or (ii) beliefs that one is in pain are epiphenomenal. For, if pains caused beliefs that one is in pain, and the latter had physical effects, then pains would, after all, have effects in the physical world (albeit indirectly). But epiphenomenalism says mental events have no effects in the physical world.[1]
The central motivation for epiphenomenalism lies in the premise that whenever there is a sufficient cause of a physical event, there is a sufficient physical cause of that event. If a mental event is something other than a physical event, then for it to make any causal contribution of its own in the physical world would require a violation of physical law. Descartes’ (1649) interactionist model proposed that nonphysical events could cause small changes in the shape of the pineal gland. But such nonphysical effects, however slight, would mean that the physical account of motion is false — for that account says that there will be no such change of shape unless there is a physical force that causes it.
One may try to rescue mental efficacy by supposing that whenever there is a mental effect in the physical world there is also a physical force that is a sufficient cause of the effect. This view, however, both offends Occamist principles and fails to satisfy the leading anti-epiphenomenalist intuition, namely, that the mental makes a difference to the physical, i.e., that it leads to behavior that would not have happened in absence of the mental. The view also leads to an epistemological problem: If there is always a sufficient physical cause for whatever a mental event is supposed to produce, then one could never be in a position where one needs to suppose there is anything non-physical at work, and thus there could never be any reason to introduce mental causes into one’s account of neural events or behavior.
Many contemporary thinkers would respond to the central motivation for epiphenomenalism by denying its dualistic presupposition, i.e., by holding that mental events are identical with physical events, and may therefore have physical effects. Questions that remain for such physicalistic views will be explained in section 3. For now, it should be noted that the argument stated in the previous two paragraphs is not supposed to be an argument for dualism, but only for adopting epiphenomenalism, once dualism is accepted.
Further support for epiphenomenalism can be derived from the fact, noted by Wilhelm Wundt (1912), that “each simple sensation is joined to a very complicated combination of peripheral and central nerve processes”, together with the fact that the causes of behavior are likewise complex neural events. This latter fact makes it natural to look for complex events throughout the causal chain leading to behavior; and these can be found in the neural events that are required for the occurrence of simple sensations. The sensations themselves could not contribute to behavior without first having neural effects that are more complex than themselves. Thus an anti-epiphenomenalist stance would require us to prefer the hypothesis that simple sensations cause (relatively) complex neural events over the hypothesis that complex neural events (that are required in any case for the causation of sensations) are adequate to cause the neural events required for the causation of behavior.

"Private social audio app Clubhouse is attracting masses of new users from mainland China, where the U.S. app remains uncensored by authorities despite flourishing discussions on rights, national identity and other sensitive topics.
Western social media apps including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are banned in China, where the local internet is tightly censored to weed out content that could undermine the ruling communist party.
The Clubhouse app, launched in early 2020, saw explosive growth in user numbers earlier this month after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev held a surprise discussion on the platform.
Its chat rooms are only accessible via invites from current members, and as of Sunday, invites to the platform were selling for between 50-400 yuan ($7.73 - $69.59) on popular Chinese e-commerce sites.
Reuters directly observed several Chinese-language ‘club’ conversations where thousands of users listened to wide-ranging audio discussions covering topics including Xinjiang detention camps, Taiwan independence and Hong Kong’s National Security Law.
China’s cyber authorities have become increasingly strict in recent years, widening the scope of apps, media outlets and social media sites banned in the country.
While Clubhouse remains uncensored, it is only available on iOS devices and is unavailable in the local Apple app store, both major barriers for its widespread use in China.
Mainland Chinese users can access the app by modifying the location of their app store.
It’s unclear why the app remains unblocked in China, though some foreign social sites with small Chinese followings manage to operate under the radar of censors, including 8kun, a central hub for QAnon followers.
In one club chat centred on Hong Kong politics, activists, journalists and artists discussed former U.S. president Trump and his support base in the former colony.
Another popular Chinese language club on the site as of Saturday involved a rare open exchange between netizens in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong over heightened political tensions in the region.
The discussion became a hot topic on China’s own Twitter-like social media site Weibo on Saturday.
“I don’t know how long this environment can last”, said one user in a popular Weibo post that was liked over 65,000 times. “But I will definitely remember this moment in Internet history.”

"It goes without saying that humans (mammals identifiable as those that stand upright and are comparatively advanced and capable of detailed thought) have pretty remarkable bodies, given all that they've accomplished. (Furthermore, an especially intelligent human brain produced this text!) To be sure, humans have overcome predators, disease, and all sorts of other obstacles over thousands of years.
To fully understand and appreciate these accomplishments, let's take at some of the most well-known parts of the human body!
The head, or the spherical body part that contains the brain and rests at the top of the human body, has quite a few individual organs and body parts on it. (It should quickly be mentioned that hair occupies the space on top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are located on either side of the head.) From top to bottom, the eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can be found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are below them, and are round, orb-like organs that allow humans to see.
The eyes make way for the nose, or an external (sticking-out) organ that plays an important part in the breathing and bacteria-elimination processes. Below that is the mouth, or a wide, cavernous organ that chews food, removes bacteria, helps with breathing, and more. The mouth contains teeth, or small, white-colored, pointed body parts used to chew food, and the tongue, or a red-colored, boneless organ used to chew food and speak.
The neck is the long body part that connects the head to the chest (the muscular body part that protects the heart and lungs), and the stomach, or the part of the body that contains food and liquid-processing organs, comes below that.
The legs are the long, muscular body parts that allow humans to move from one spot to another and perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains a thigh (a thick, especially muscular body part used to perform strenuous motions; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible body part that absorbs the shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). Feet can be found at the bottom of legs, and each foot is comprised of five toes, or small appendages that help balance.
Arms are long, powerful body parts that are located on either side of chest, below the shoulders;arms are comprised of biceps (the thicker, more powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner, more flexible lower portion). Hands, or small, gripping body parts used for a tremendous number of actions, are at the end of arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to grip objects.
The aforementioned shoulders are rounded body parts that aid arms' flexibility. One's back is found on the opposite side of the stomach, and is a flat section of the body that contains important muscles that're intended to protect the lungs and other internal organs, in addition to helping humans perform certain motions and actions.","C2"
"Reality television featuring law enforcement officers on the beat is nothing new. A show featuring a lawman who makes jailed inmates wear pink underwear and uses actors to trick suspects, however, is a new twist.
Maricopa Co.. Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has his own TV show, Smile: You 're Under Arrest. 
Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose showy brand of justice has raised charges of discrimination and civil-rights abuses while making him a hero among fans of his tough-on-crime attitudes -- will star in Smile: You 're Under Arrest. 
The show, which premiers this weekend on Fox Reality Channel, features Arpaio and other officers using elaborate ploys crafted by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with outstanding warrants.
In one, a suspect is invited to a fake fashion shoot and told he's going to become a supermodel, according to Fox Reality's Web site. In another, a suspect is tricked into what he thinks is a job as a movie extra and, after a staged argument between the film's director and another actor, gets promoted to the starring role.
 It's kind of fun to show how stupid they are and, as I say, the looks on their face, Arpaio, 76, said of the suspects wanted for DUIs, drug charges, missed court dates and other offenses. Watch Arpaio explain his methods 
But Arpaio's critics are n't amused.
They say they fear the show will give the controversial sheriff positive publicity, ignoring what they call a darker side to his 16-year tenure as top lawman in the county that includes Phoenix.
 It's going to celebrate a sheriff that's frankly scaring this community, a sheriff that has seen violent crime increase significantly in his county, a sheriff that is racially profiling the Latino community, and I doubt that the show is going to reflect that, said Paco Fabian, spokesman for the immigrant-rights group America's Voice.
In a statement on the group's Web site, Fabian calls Arpaio a modern day Bull Connor, comparing him to the public safety commissioner in 1960s Birmingham, Alabama, whose use of attack dogs and firehoses on civil rights demonstrators made him a symbol of racial intolerance.
Dubbed America's Toughest Sheriff, Arpaio makes many of his county's 10,000 or so inmates live in tents. He reinstituted chain gangs -- including crews for women and juveniles -- banned smoking, coffee and movies in his jails and, most recently, moved to require all inmates with money in their jail accounts to pay for their own meals.
And then, of course, there's the pink underwear.
 They were stealing the white underwear, smuggling the underwear out of the jail, Arpaio told CNN. So you know what ? Give them pink. The other reason is they hate pink. Why would you give the 10,000 inmates the color they like ? 
Earlier this year, the mayor of Phoenix wrote a letter to the U.S. attorney general's office, asking the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division to investigate Arpaio's aggressive illegal immigration crackdowns. Mayor Phil Brown wrote that Arpaio's sweeps show a pattern and practice of conduct that includes discriminatory harassment, improper stops, searches and arrests. 
The letter came after Arpaio, who had already been the target of hundreds of lawsuits, launched a series of what he calls crime-suppression patrols in largely Latino neighborhoods. Critics say the patrols use racial profiling to unfairly target Hispanic drivers and pedestrians, while Arpaio says they have resulted in the deportation of hundreds of illegal immigrants, including some with criminal records.
 We are the only ones cracking down on the state's human smuggling law, Arpaio said.
Fabian said America's Voice is considering putting pressure on companies that advertise during Arpaio's show. Either way, the series offers another moment in the spotlight for a lawman who has never shied away from it.
 I 'm not going to brag, Arpaio said, but there is n't anybody in the world who does n't know who this sheriff is.

"Hume proposes that feeling, not thought, informs us that an object is beautiful or ugly, or that an action exhibits virtue or vice: “The very feeling constitutes our praise or admiration” (T, 471). The feeling or sentiment is itself an aesthetic or moral discrimination. It is prior to, and the basis of, any subsequent expression of praise or admiration. The sentiment is the beauty of the object and it is the virtue of desirable human action. Sentiment is the sole source of values governing human activity. Taste is a “productive faculty, and gilding or staining all natural objects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises, in a manner, a new creation.” That new creation is “beauty and deformity, virtue and vice” (EPM, 294). However, the sentiment is calm rather than violent, so an unphilosophical perspective treats it as a property “of the object” (S, 218).
This moral and aesthetic subjectivism attracts Hume for the same reason that it attracts Hutcheson. The appeal to sentiment offers a middle position between the two prevailing theories within English letters, Hobbesian egoism and ethical rationalism. Hutcheson holds that virtue and beauty are not qualities of the people and things to which they are attributed. We may speak as if objects and people have moral and aesthetic properties, but the relevant property is merely an “idea raised in us.” Hume alters Hutcheson’s theory by imposing his own philosophical vocabulary, making beauty an impression rather than an idea. But they agree that to describe a person as virtuous or an object as beautiful is to make a claim about their tendency to cause a certain response. Is it imprudent and “too strong,” Hume asks Hutcheson, to summarize the thesis in the following terms (HL, I, 39–40)? “[W]hen you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue, therefore, may be compared to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind” (T, 469). Emphasizing Hume’s debt to Hutcheson, Kivy (2003, pp. 307–310), argues that Hume understands beauty very much on the model of colors. Although they are secondary qualities and so do not directly reveal the properties of the occasioning object, some color perception is “true and real” (SOT, 272), and so it is for Hume likewise with beauty. However, virtue and beauty are not strictly analogous to secondary qualities, such as heat and cold, because a critic’s claim that a work is beautiful involves an element of endorsement that does not arise in the observation that ice is cold. The case against reading Humean beauty on the model of ideas of secondary qualities is provided by Shiner (1996) and Taylor (2011).
Hume defends the centrality of sentiment with the following reasoning. Recognitions of virtue and beauty require particular sentiments in human observers. If the discriminations of taste took place without these sentiments, we would lack any motivation to do what we regard as moral. Moral and aesthetic judgments have practical consequences that mere reason lacks. So taste differs from the assent that characterizes understanding or reason (T, 458; EPM, 172; S, 219). Although taste responds to real qualities of objects, we cannot replace the exercise of taste with the assent of reason. In many cases, beauty and gracefulness (both aesthetic and moral) are inexplicable; they resist our efforts at explication, and we must trust the “sure testimony of taste and sentiment” (EPM, 267).","C2"
"Tokyo -LRB- CNN -RRB- A Japanese court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country, citing safety concerns, a court official told CNN.
Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's Takahama nuclear plant.
But locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui Prefecture, where the plant is located, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake.
Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant.
Since then, the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy, arguing it is essential to the country's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports.
But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart.
Keith Henry, managing director of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, which advises businesses on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy.
 That was a body blow -LSB- for Abe -RSB- because it's no longer a political issue, it's a legal issue. It changes the calculus and the dynamics, he said.
 It's now in the courts. And the government is powerless to do anything about it.

Anti-nuclear activists celebrated following the Fukui District Court's decision in their favor Tuesday.
The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster.
It said in a statement that scientific and professional findings showed that the safety of the reactors was assured.
But the court ruled that the new safety standards were loose, lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said.
The power company said it would appeal the decision. We deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended, and can not accept it at all, it said in a statement.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tuesday that the country's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the world's strictest safety standards.
The government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart, he said.
Takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations.
Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture's governor, although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court.
Analyst Henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the Takahama decision, as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives.
Prior to the Fukushima disaster, about 30 % of Japan's energy was nuclear generated.

"﻿The National Security Agency (NSA) has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top-secret document. The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says. 
The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims “collection directly from the servers” of major US service providers. Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program. 
In a statement, Google said: “Google cares deeply about the security of our users’ data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data.” 
Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of PRISM or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. “If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge,” one said. An Apple spokesman said he had “never heard” of PRISM. 
The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law, introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012. The program facilitates extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US. It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants. 
Disclosure of the PRISM program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a top-secret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers. The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records, this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata. Some of the world’s largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the information-sharing program since its introduction in 2007. Microsoft – which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan “Your privacy is our priority” – was the first, with collection beginning in December 2007. It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple, which joined the program in 2012. The program is continuing to expand, with other providers due to come online. Collectively, the companies cover the vast majority of online email, search, video and communications networks. The extent and nature of the data collected from each company varies. Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users’ communications under US law, but the PRISM program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies’ servers. The NSA document notes the operations have the “assistance of communications providers in the US ”. The revelation also supports concerns raised by several US senators during the renewal of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) in December 2012, who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces. When the FAA was first enacted, defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA’s inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. 
But the PRISM program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies’ servers. 
A chart prepared by the NSA, contained within the top-secret document, highlights the breadth of the data it is able to obtain: email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example) chats, file transfers, social networking details and more. The document is recent, dating to April 2013. Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA, which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy. 
The PRISM program allows the NSA, the world’s largest surveillance organization, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders. With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications and perform real-time collection on targeted users. 
A senior administration official said in a statement: “The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States. The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-US persons outside the US are targeted and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons. 
“This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate. Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.”

"The six-point peace plan for Syria proposed by Kofi Annan is doomed to fail for one simple reason: Neither President Bashar al-Assad nor the government opposition is interested in making it work.
For al-Assad, full implementation of the plan, which includes a political settlement through dialogue and respect for the rights of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, will bring an end to his regime. From the onset of the uprisings, his government knew that a repeat of the protests in Egypt's Tahrir Square or Bahrain's Pearl Square in Damascus or Aleppo will mean regime change. Al-Assad and his inner circle are not about to create conditions that are conducive for such sit-ins just because the Annan plan calls on them to do so.
For the opposition groups, Annan could spend all the time he wants on negotiations, but any talks not predicated on al-Assad's stepping aside will not be acceptable. The activists who are spearheading Syria's revolution insist that the opposition exile leadership has a limited mandate and that is to discuss details for the transfer of power from the Assad family to the opposition.
The bottom line is that the two main protagonists in the conflict look at the Annan plan as a means to achieve their respective, mutually exclusive objectives.
By agreeing to the Annan plan, al-Assad pursues a dual-track strategy: He appeases his Russian and Iranian allies, who have been pressuring him to accept a political solution, while working to kill his way out of the crisis under the pretext that he is confronting armed terrorists and gangs. 
The opposition wants the cease-fire in order to field mass protests. As one activist from Hama put it to me recently: We do n't need military intervention, we do n't need humanitarian corridors, we do n't need safe areas. Enforce the cease-fire and millions will march toward the presidential palace demanding Assad's ouster. 
After more than a year of uprisings, Syria is still stuck in a violent stalemate. Al-Assad has not been able to crush the opposition, and opposition seems nowhere near to dislodging al-Assad. Increasingly, the conflict is being framed in existential terms, with some involved becoming more radicalized.
The majority of Alawites believe their physical survival is at stake, because they are convinced al-Assad's demise will engender wide-scale revenge killings on them. Hence, they will not accept a solution that will produce a new regime in which they are not guaranteed a leading role. Similarly, the opposition groups believe that if they stop now and al-Assad remains in power, he will hunt them down.
Absent a game changer that will tip the balance in favor of one side or the other, the crisis in Syria will become a full-blown sectarian war pitting Sunnis against Alawites, which will likely spill over into the neighboring countries of Iraq and Lebanon.
Although military options have been considered by the West, it's hard to say whether that would make a difference in reversing the dynamics in the country. A military operation might cause a regional war involving Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran, with each country supporting its allies in Syria.
For now, Iran's Supreme Leader has cast his support firmly with al-Assad. A well-informed Iranian source told me that the Iranian regime will support al-Assad no matter what until the end. On the other hand, Russia's Syria policy seems to be in flux judging by its vote in the United Nations recently. It's too early to tell whether Russia will ease al-Assad out the way Saudi Arabia did in the case of Yemen's Abdullah Saleh. Russia and Iran will probably not abandon al-Assad until they are part of the deal-making process about Syria's future government.
One possible game changer is if the protest movement in Syria becomes widespread and covers large stretches of the country.
To date, only four of Syria's 14 governorates constitute the major hubs of the protest movement: Homs, Hama, Idlib and Daraa. While we have seen protests in other regions, they have not been as sustained and extensive as those in the four governorates. This is partly due to the state of fragmentation in the opposition ranks, especially among the exile groups, which do not inspire confidence among fence-sitters.
Although large segments of fence-sitters including businessmen have come around to supporting the opposition, many remain ambivalent because they doubt the opposition will succeed in overthrowing al-Assad. This perception is reinforced by the fact that Annan's plan does not call for al-Assad to step down -- a detail that is not missed by the Assad regime propaganda machine.
While the exile opposition remains divided, there are hopeful signs that the opposition ranks within Syria are becoming better organized, better trained and gaining legitimacy.
The future leaders of Syria will not come from the Syrian National Council or the National Coordination Committee for Change; they will emerge from the ranks of the revolutionary councils that are forming in different parts of the country.
These councils bring together an eclectic mix of the most active local coordinating committees, independent activists, community and business leaders and military defectors. They are putting in place an administrative infrastructure that is akin to a local provincial council, handling everything from media affairs to helping families who lost their homes to providing legal aid to jailed activists. They are also coordinating with each other to protect relief supply lines that cross their respective territories. In the process, the leaders in these councils, who hail from Syria's different religious and ethnic groups, are developing political skills, cultivating local constituencies and learning through trial and error the business of governing.
In a country that is increasingly polarized along sectarian and ethnic lines, these councils can perhaps provide the glue that keeps the country stitched together.

"Although in Western philosophy the earliest formulation of a version of the cosmological argument is found in Plato’s Laws, 893–96, the classical argument is firmly rooted in Aristotle’s Physics (VIII, 4–6) and Metaphysics (XII, 1–6). Islamic philosophy enriches the tradition, developing two types of arguments. Arabic philosophers (falasifa), such as Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037), developed the argument from contingency, which was taken up by Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) in his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3) and in his Summa Contra Gentiles (I, 13). Influenced by John Philoponus (5th c) (Davidson 1969), the mutakallimūm—theologians who used reason and argumentation to support their revealed Islamic beliefs—developed the temporal version of the argument from the impossibility of an infinite regress, now referred to as the kalām cosmological argument. For example, al-Ghāzāli (1058–1111) argued that everything that begins to exist requires a cause of its beginning. The world is composed of temporal phenomena preceded by other temporally-ordered phenomena. Since such a series of temporal phenomena cannot continue to infinity because an actual infinite is impossible, the world must have had a beginning and a cause of its existence, termed Allah or God (Craig 1979: part 1). This version of the cosmological argument entered the medieval Christian tradition through Bonaventure (1221–74) in his Sentences (II Sent. D.1,p.1,a.1,q.2).
Enlightenment thinkers, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Samuel Clarke, reaffirmed the cosmological argument. Leibniz (1646–1716) appealed to a strengthened principle of sufficient reason, according to which “no fact can be real or existing and no statement true without a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise” (Monadology, §32). Leibniz uses the principle to argue that the sufficient reason for the “series of things comprehended in the universe of creatures” (§36) must exist outside this series of contingencies and is found in a necessary being that we call God. Samuel Clarke likewise employed the principle of sufficient reason in his cosmological argument (Rowe 1975: chap. 2).
Although the cosmological argument does not figure prominently in Asian philosophy, a very abbreviated version of it, proceeding from dependence, can be found in Udayana’s Nyāyakusumāñjali I,4. In general, philosophers in the Nyāya tradition argue that since the universe has parts that come into existence at one occasion and not another, it must have a cause. We could admit an infinite regress of causes if we had evidence for such, but lacking such evidence, God must exist as the non-dependent cause. Many of the objections to the argument contend that God is an inappropriate cause because of God’s nature. For example, since God is immobile and has no body, he cannot properly be said to cause anything. The Naiyāyikas reply that God could assume a body at certain times, and in any case, God need not create in the same way humans do (Potter 1977: 100–07).
The cosmological argument came under serious assault in the 18th century, first by David Hume and then by Immanuel Kant. Hume (1748) attacked both the view of causation presupposed in the argument (that causation is an objective, productive, necessary power relation that holds between two things) and the Causal Principle—every contingent being has a cause of its existence—that lies at the heart of the argument. Kant contended that the cosmological argument, in identifying the necessary being, relies on the ontological argument, which in turn is suspect. We will return to these criticisms below.
Both theists and nontheists in the last part of the 20th century and the first part of the 21st century generally show a healthy skepticism about the argument. Alvin Plantinga concludes “that this piece of natural theology is ineffective” (1967: chap. 1). Richard Gale contends, in Kantian fashion, that since the conclusion of all versions of the cosmological argument invokes an impossibility, no cosmological arguments can provide examples of sound reasoning (1991: chap. 7). (However, Gale seems to have changed his mind and in recent writings proposed and defended his own version of the cosmological argument, which we will consider below.) Similarly, Michael Martin (1990: chap. 4), John Mackie (1982: chap. 5), Quentin Smith (Craig and Smith 1993), Bede Rundle (2004), Wes Morriston (2000, 2002a, 2003, 2010), and Graham Oppy (2006: chap. 3) reason that no current version of the cosmological argument is sound. Yet dissenting voices can be heard. Robert Koons (1997) employs mereology and modal and nonmonotonic logic in taking a “new look” at the argument from contingency. In his widely discussed writings William Lane Craig marshals multidisciplinary evidence for the truth of the premises found in the kalām argument. Richard Gale and Alexander Pruss propose a new version based on a so-called weak principle of sufficient reason that leads to a finite God that is not omnibenevolent, and Richard Swinburne, though rejecting deductive versions of the cosmological argument, proposes an inductive argument that is part of a larger cumulative case for God’s existence.
There is quite a chance that if there is a God he will make something of the finitude and complexity of a universe. It is very unlikely that a universe would exist uncaused, but rather more likely that God would exist uncaused. The existence of the universe…can be made comprehensible if we suppose that it is brought about by God. (Swinburne 1979: 131–32)
More recently, Michael Almeida constructed a new version of the argument based on modal realism. In short, in contrast to the first half of the last century, contemporary philosophers contribute increasingly detailed, complex, and sophisticated arguments on both sides of the debate.","C2"
"Regius attributed his appointment at Utrecht University to his familiarity with and support for Cartesian philosophy, which was acquired initially by reading Descartes’ first book, the Discours de la Méthode … plus la Dioptrique, les Météores et la Géometrie, 1637 (AT, vol. VI). Regius was sympathetic to Cartesian natural philosophy from his initial reading and began to teach it to students, in private lessons, and to dictate notes with a view to publishing his own summary of natural philosophy based on Cartesian principles. This objective was further encouraged when he read a copy of Descartes’ unpublished manuscript, Le Monde (AT, vol. XI), in 1641. The natural philosophy of Le Monde rejected scholastic forms and qualities as philosophical entities that contributed nothing to an explanation of natural phenomena. There was a significant difference, however, in a university such as Utrecht between not relying on scholastic forms and criticizing them publicly. The transition from the former to the latter, in the case of Regius, occurred in 1641.
While preparing Physiologia (Regius 1641a), Regius sent advance copies of draft disputations to Descartes. Since they were being presented in Utrecht as examples of Cartesian philosophy, Descartes recommended various changes, both to avoid needless controversy (for example, concerning blood circulation) and, more importantly, to avoid accusations of heresy against himself or Regius. Accordingly, he asked Regius to correct the thesis that the human soul is three-fold, and to argue instead that “in human beings the soul is one, namely a rational soul” (AT III, 369–74: Bos 2002, 63–69). During the year 1641, this pattern of prior consultation with Descartes continued; Regius accepted many of Descartes’ suggestions, and incorporated them into the final versions of the disputations.
In November 1641, however, the Utrecht professor inaugurated another series of disputations in which he transgressed from medicine to philosophy and, by implication, into theology, and thereby provoked a controversy that continued for more than a decade. The most explicit challenge to established Aristotelian teaching occurred when one of Regius’ students, Henricus van Loon, claimed in a disputation (8 December 1641) that the human mind and body are two distinct substances which are joined together in an accidental union [unum per accidens]. This thesis addressed, perhaps inadvertently, one of the most contentious issues in Christian philosophy and theology, viz. how to understand the unity of human nature, as experienced by each subject, and at the same time defend the traditional Christian beliefs in the immortality of the human soul or mind and the resurrection of the body. The immortality of the soul seemed to presuppose that the mind or soul was capable of existing without the body and, for that reason, that it should be classified as an Aristotelian substance. When Descartes was informed about this disputation (when it was already too late to recommend amendments), he responded that there was hardly anything more likely to offend or antagonize theologians than to say that a human being “is an accidental being” (AT III, 460: Bos 2002, 90–91).
Voetius, with the support of his professorial colleagues in theology, replied to Regius by appending corollaries to his own theological disputations, in December 1641, in which he accused proponents of the ‘new philosophy’ [i.e., Cartesianism] of a number of errors: teaching that a human being is an accidental being, defending Copernicanism, and supporting scepticism and irreligion by denying substantial forms. In the course of these replies to Regius, Descartes’ name was also mentioned, and it was clear that Regius and Descartes were perceived by Voetius as jointly attempting to undermine the philosophical foundations of Calvinist theology as taught at Utrecht. Initially, Descartes joined the debate merely by advising Regius how to respond appropriately to Voetius. One part of that advice was that Regius should have dealt with substantial forms as Descartes had done in the Météores (AT VI, 239): that he should not have rejected them explicitly but, instead, should merely have omitted them as redundant to genuine explanations.
However, Descartes also provided Regius with philosophical arguments in reply to Voetius. He outlined a number of reasons why they were jointly opposed to describing the human mind as a substantial form. To say that human beings think because they have a ‘thinking form’ explains nothing; secondly, those who postulate the existence of substantial forms are unable to say more precisely what they are, and thus they appeal to ‘occult’ realities that they do not understand; and, perhaps most importantly, if the alleged substantial forms of other natural phenomena were made redundant by developments in physics, there would be a danger that the spirituality of the mind or soul would be compromised by similar advances in the sciences. “All the arguments that are used to prove substantial forms may be applied to the form of a clock, although no one claims that it is substantial” (AT III, 505: Bos 2002, 115). Many of Descartes’ suggestions were incorporated, as amendments, into the final version of the Regius’ reply to Voetius, which appeared as Responsio, sive notae in Appendicem (Regius 1642) on 16 February 1642. This further inflamed the situation. The following month, Regius was forbidden by the University to teach natural philosophy in public or in private, and was restricted to lecturing in traditional medicine. The Academic Senate, with the approval of the town council, also issued an official condemnation of Cartesian philosophy.","C2"
"﻿It began with a bogus scallop, but a menu scandal that has engulfed some of Japan’s most prestigious hotels and department stores now threatens to undermine the international reputation of the country’s vaunted cuisine. 
Since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about the provenance of ingredients on its menus, Japanese media have served up almost daily revelations of similar transgressions by restaurants run by well-known hotels and department stores. 
The frenzy began when the Hankyu-Hanshin hotel chain, based in Osaka, admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013, affecting an estimated 78,000 diners. 
Among the chief menu misdemeanours was a red salmon 'caviar' dish that turned out to be the less sumptuous eggs of the flying fish. 
A televised attempt by the hotel group’s president, Hiroshi Desaki, to limit the damage by announcing a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives, failed to mollify angry consumers. 
Days later, Desaki resigned, conceding that the hotel group had “betrayed our customers”, although he added: “We never had the intention to deceive them.” One of the hotel’s head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was due to receive from the government. 
The company has so far refunded more than 10,000 consumers to the tune of 20m yen; the eventual bill is expected to reach 110m yen. 
Japan’s version of the UK horsemeat scandal has since spread to several household names in catering. While, as in the UK, no one has fallen ill from eating mislabelled produce, the outbreak of anger shows no sign of abating. Consumers who believed they had eaten prized kuruma shrimps, for example, were told they had in fact dined on the much cheaper black tiger version. 
The first incident went almost unnoticed. The Prince Hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a 'scallop' dish he had ordered contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish. 
The hotel launched an investigation and went on to correct more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. Its report scared Hankyu-Hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients. 
The Hotel Okura chain – whose guests have included Barack Obama – confessed myriad sins, including injecting beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly describing tomatoes as organic. 
“We deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients,” it said in a statement. 
The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones; bought-in chocolate cream masquerading as home-made; imported beef sold as high-end wagyu. 
Even the government’s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, was moved to comment on the scandal. “These incidents have surfaced one after the other and this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers,” he told reporters. “These are clearly cover-ups.” 
The fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time. Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift bans on food imports imposed in response to the Fukushima nuclear accident, while UNESCO is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its intangible cultural heritage list. 
One local newspaper ran the headline, “Japan’s proud food culture in tears,” while the mass circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said it was “astonished by the industry’s lack of morals.” 
The newspaper voiced concerns that the scandal could “harm the credibility of brand Japan, products and services, which are praised by foreign countries and tourists for their safety and security.” 
Industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions. 
“Menu descriptions were created to meet consumers’ preference for brand products, and, when they couldn’t obtain the ingredients stated on the menu, hotels just used food from different places of origin,” Hiroshi Tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told Kyodo News. 
While they count the cost to their reputations, the hotels and restaurants involved are unlikely to face legal action. Menus are not covered by the agricultural standards law or by a new food labelling law due to go into effect in 2015. The authorities’ only legal weapon is a law banning misleading representations of goods and services. 
The industry’s biggest nemesis will be Japan’s discerning and demanding consumers. In a 2009 poll conducted by an online restaurant guide, 72% of respondents said provenance was the most important factor in selecting dishes from a menu, followed by calorific and nutritional details.

"Scientists have connected the brains of a pair of animals and allowed them to share sensory information in a major step towards what the researchers call the world’s first “organic computer”. 
The US team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. In one radical demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to link the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles, with one in the researchers’ lab at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and the other in Natal, Brazil. 
Led by Miguel Nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts, the researchers say their latest work may enable multiple brains to be hooked up to share information. “These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication linkage between brains,” Nicolelis said in a statement. “Basically, we are creating what I call an organic computer.” 
The scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each other’s sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach into the motor cortex, the brain region that processes movement. 
The rats were trained to press a lever when a light went on above it. When they performed the task correctly, they got a drink of water. To test the animals’ ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. Only one compartment had a light that came on above the lever. When the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat’s brain. In trials, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals 70% of the time by pressing the lever. 
Remarkably, the communication between the rats was two-way. If the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat was not rewarded with a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. In further experiments, the rats collaborated on a task that required them to distinguish between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers. 
In the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and beamed their brain activity back and forth over the internet. “Even though the animals were on different continents, with the resulting noisy transmission and signal delays, they could still communicate,” said Miguel Pais-Vieira, the first author of the study. “This tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.” 
Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to link several animals’ brains at once to solve more complex tasks. “We cannot even predict what kinds of emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part of a 'brain-net',” he said. “In theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.” The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports. 
Anders Sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, said the work was “very important” in helping to understand how brains encode information. But the implications of the technology and its potential future uses are far broader, said Sandberg. “The main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. Without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.” 
“I don’t think there’s any risk of supersmart rats from this,” he added. “There’s a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. I’m not worried about an imminent invasion of 'rat multiborgs'.”  
Very little is known about how thoughts are encoded and how they might be transmitted into another person’s brain, so that is not a realistic prospect any time soon. And much of what is in our minds is what Sandberg calls a “draft” of what we might do. “Often, we don’t want to reveal those drafts; that would be embarrassing and confusing. And a lot of those drafts are changed before we act. Most of the time I think we’d be very thankful not to be in someone else’s head.”   ","C2"
"Colonialism is not a modern phenomenon. World history is full of examples of one society gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent territory and settling its people on newly conquered territory. The ancient Greeks set up colonies as did the Romans, the Moors, and the Ottomans, to name just a few of the most famous examples. Colonialism, then, is not restricted to a specific time or place. Nevertheless, in the sixteenth century, colonialism changed decisively because of technological developments in navigation that began to connect more remote parts of the world. Fast sailing ships made it possible to reach distant ports and to sustain close ties between the center and colonies. Thus, the modern European colonial project emerged when it became possible to move large numbers of people across the ocean and to maintain political sovereignty in spite of geographical dispersion. This entry uses the term colonialism to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world, including the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia.
The difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the term is often used as a synonym for imperialism. Both colonialism and imperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit Europe economically and strategically. The term colonialism is frequently used to describe the settlement of North America, Australia, New Zealand, Algeria, and Brazil, places that were controlled by a large population of permanent European residents. The term imperialism often describes cases in which a foreign government administers a territory without significant settlement; typical examples include the scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth century and the American domination of the Philippines and Puerto Rico. The distinction between the two, however, is not entirely consistent in the literature. Some scholars distinguish between colonies for settlement and colonies for economic exploitation. Others use the term colonialism to describe dependencies that are directly governed by a foreign nation and contrast this with imperialism, which involves indirect forms of domination.
The confusion about the meaning of the term imperialism reflects the way that the concept has changed over time. Although the English word imperialism was not commonly used before the nineteenth century, Elizabethans already described the United Kingdom as “the British Empire.” As Britain began to acquire overseas dependencies, the concept of empire was employed more frequently. Imperialism was understood as a system of military domination and sovereignty over territories. The day to day work of government might be exercised indirectly through local assemblies or indigenous rulers who paid tribute, but sovereignty rested with the British. The shift away from this traditional understanding of empire was influenced by the Leninist analysis of imperialism as a system oriented towards economic exploitation. According to Lenin, imperialism was the necessary and inevitable result of the logic of accumulation in late capitalism. Thus, for Lenin and subsequent Marxists, imperialism described a historical stage of capitalism rather than a trans-historical practice of political and military domination. The lasting impact of the Marxist approach is apparent in contemporary debates about American imperialism, a term which usually means American economic hegemony, regardless of whether such power is exercised directly or indirectly (Young 2001).
Given the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two terms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers to the project of European political domination from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation movements of the 1960s. Post-colonialism will be used to describe the political and theoretical struggles of societies that experienced the transition from political dependence to sovereignty. This entry will use imperialism as a broad term that refers to economic, military, political domination that is achieved without significant permanent European settlement.

"Conceptual difficulties have plagued quantum mechanics since its inception, despite its extraordinary predictive successes. The basic problem, plainly put, is this: It is not at all clear what quantum mechanics is about. What, in fact, does quantum mechanics describe?
It might seem, since it is widely agreed that any quantum mechanical system is completely described by its wave function, that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about the behavior of wave functions. Quite naturally, no physicist wanted this to be true more than did Erwin Schrödinger, the father of the wave function. Nonetheless, Schrödinger ultimately found this impossible to believe. His difficulty had little to do with the novelty of the wave function:
That it is an abstract, unintuitive mathematical construct is a scruple that almost always surfaces against new aids to thought and that carries no great message. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 327)
Rather, it was that the “blurring” that the spread out character of the wave function suggests “affects macroscopically tangible and visible things, for which the term ‘blurring’ seems simply wrong”.
For example, in the same paper Schrödinger noted that it may happen in radioactive decay that
the emerging particle is described … as a spherical wave … that impinges continuously on a surrounding luminescent screen over its full expanse. The screen however does not show a more or less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights up at one instant at one spot …. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 327–328)
And he observed that one can easily arrange, for example by including a cat in the system, “quite ridiculous cases” with
the ψ-function of the entire system having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 328)
It is thus because of the “measurement problem”, of macroscopic superpositions, that Schrödinger found it difficult to regard the wave function as “representing reality”. But then what does? With evident disapproval, Schrödinger observes that
the reigning doctrine rescues itself or us by having recourse to epistemology. We are told that no distinction is to be made between the state of a natural object and what I know about it, or perhaps better, what I can know about it if I go to some trouble. Actually—so they say—there is intrinsically only awareness, observation, measurement. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 328)
Many physicists pay lip service to the Copenhagen interpretation—that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about observation or results of measurement. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to find any who, when pressed, will defend this interpretation. It seems clear that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about atoms and electrons, quarks and strings, not those particular macroscopic regularities associated with what we call measurements of the properties of these things. But if these entities are not somehow identified with the wave function itself—and if talk of them is not merely shorthand for elaborate statements about measurements—then where are they to be found in the quantum description?
There is, perhaps, a very simple reason why it is so difficult to discern in the quantum description the objects we believe quantum mechanics ought to describe. Perhaps the quantum mechanical description is not the whole story, a possibility most prominently associated with Albert Einstein. (For a general discussion of Einstein’s scientific philosophy, and in particular of his approach to the conflicting positions of realism and positivism, see the entry on Einstein’s philosophy of science.)
In 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen defended this possibility in their famous EPR paper. They concluded with this observation:
While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible. (Einstein et al. 1935: 780)","C2"
"I shall refer to the brand of knowledge Descartes seeks in the Meditations, as ‘perfect knowledge’. Famously, he defines perfect knowledge in terms of doubt. While distinguishing lesser grades of conviction, and perfect knowledge,he writes:
I distinguish the two as follows: there is conviction [persuasio] when there remains some reason which might lead us to doubt, but knowledge [scientia] is conviction based on a reason so strong that it can never be shaken by any stronger reason. (24 May 1640 letter to Regius, AT 3:65, CSMK 147)
In the Second Replies, he adds:
I shall now expound for a second time the basis on which it seems to me that all human certainty can be founded.
      First of all, as soon as we think that we correctly perceive something, we are spontaneously convinced that it is true. Now if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for us ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced of, then there are no further questions for us to ask: we have everything that we could reasonably want. … For the supposition which we are making here is of a conviction so firm that it is quite incapable of being destroyed; and such a conviction is clearly the same as the most perfect certainty. (AT 7:144f, CSM 2:103)
These passages (and others) suggest an account wherein doubt is the contrast of certainty. As my certainty increases, my doubt decreases; conversely, as my doubt increases, my certainty decreases. The requirement that knowledge is to be based in complete, or perfect certainty, thus amounts to requiring a complete inability to doubt one’s convictions – an utter indubitability. This conception of the relationship between certainty and doubt helps underwrite Descartes’ methodical emphasis on doubt, the so-called ‘method of doubt’ (discussed in Section 2).
That perfect knowledge requires that it be “impossible for us ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced of” marks an extraordinarily high standard of justification. Is this the only standard deserving of knowledge-talk? This is a difficult question to answer, because Descartes didn’t write in English. But arguably he’s an epistemic contextualist, at least in the sense of invoking the notion of knowledge in divergent contexts that presuppose different epistemic standards. We’ll see, for example, that he holds that even the deductive demonstrations of expert geometers fall short of the standards needed for perfect knowledge; yet, the kind of terminology he uses to characterize their epistemic achievements is routinely rendered in terms of knowledge-talk, in standard English translations of his work.
The certainty/indubitability of interest to Descartes is psychological in character, though not merely psychological – not simply an inexplicable feeling. It has also a distinctively epistemic character, involving a kind of rational insight. During moments of certainty, it is as if my perception is guided by “a great light in the intellect” (Med. 4, AT 7:59, CSM 2:41). This rational illumination empowers me to “see utterly clearly with my mind’s eye”; my feelings of certainty are grounded – indeed, “I see a manifest contradiction” in denying the proposition of which I’m convinced.","C2"
"﻿The forests – and suburbs – of Europe are echoing with the growls, howls and silent padding of large predators, according to a new study that shows that brown bears, wolves and lynx are thriving on a crowded continent. Despite fears that large carnivores are doomed to extinction because of rising human populations and overconsumption, a study published in Science has found that large-predator populations are stable or rising in Europe. 
Brown bears, wolves, the Eurasian lynx and wolverines are found in nearly one-third of mainland Europe (excluding Belarus, Ukraine and Russia), with most individuals living outside nature reserves, indicating that changing attitudes and landscape-scale conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history. 
Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in Europe, with around 17,000 individuals, alongside 12,000 wolves, 9,000 Eurasian lynx and 1,250 wolverines, which are restricted to northern parts of Scandinavia and Finland. Only Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe – like Britain – have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species. But the paper’s lead author and other conservationists said these animals’ surprising distribution across well-populated regions of Europe showed that even the British countryside could support big predators. 
Guillaume Chapron from Sweden’s University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre – higher than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle. On average in Europe, wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km, lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km. The population density of the Scottish Highlands is nine people per sq km. 
“In order to have wolves, we don’t need to remove people from the landscape,” said Chapron. According to Chapron and his colleagues, the big-carnivore revival shows the success of a “land-sharing” model of conservation – in stark contrast to keeping predators and people apart by fencing off “wilderness” areas, as occurs in North America and Africa. 
“I’m not saying it’s a peace-and-love story – coexistence often means conflict – but it’s important to manage that conflict, keep it at a low level and resolve the problems it causes. Wolves can be difficult neighbours,” said Chapron. “We shouldn’t be talking about people-predator conflict; we have conflict between people about predators. These animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land.” 
According to the researchers, this “land-sharing” approach could be applied elsewhere in the world. The reasons for its success in Europe include political stability, burgeoning populations of prey species such as wild deer and financial support for non-lethal livestock protection such as electric fences, which mean that farmers do not resort to shooting wild predators. Most crucial, said Chapron, has been the EU Habitats Directive, which has compelled member states to protect and revive rare species. 
“Without the Habitats Directive, I don’t think we would have had this recovery,” he said. “It shows, if people are willing to protect nature and if political will is translated into strong legislation like the Habitats Directive, it’s possible to achieve results in wildlife protection.” The revival was welcomed by author and commentator George Monbiot, who is launching Rewilding Britain, a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species. 
“It is great to see the upward trend continuing but Britain is completely anomalous – we’ve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for Ireland,” he said. “Apart from the accidental reintroduction of boar, we’ve done almost nothing, whereas, in much of the rest of Europe, we’ve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back. It’s a massive turnaround from the centuries of persecution.” 
The survey found the Eurasian lynx living permanently in 11 population groups across 23 European countries, of which only five were native populations, indicating the success of reintroduction efforts. According to Monbiot, momentum is building for the reintroduction of the lynx into the Cairngorms in Scotland. 
“If it works in the rest of Europe, there’s absolutely no reason why it can’t work in the UK,” he said, pointing out that bears and wolves are found within an hour of Rome. “There’s no demographic reason why we can’t have a similar return of wildlife in the UK.”  ","C2"
"A Christian holiday signifying the birth of Jesus, Christmas is widely celebrated and enjoyed across the United States and the world. The holiday always falls on 25 December (regardless of the day of the week), and is typically accompanied by decorations, presents, and special meals.
Specifically, the legend behind Christmas (and the one that most children are told) is that Santa Claus, a bearded, hefty, jolly, and red-jacket-wearing old man who lives in the North Pole, spends the year crafting presents with his elves, or small, festive, excited Santa-assistants. All the children who behave throughout the year are admitted to the Good List, and will presumably receive their desired gifts on Christmas, while those who don't behave are placed on the Naughty List, and will presumably (although the matter is determined by parents) receive a lump of coal.
Santa Claus is said to fly around the Christmas sky in a sled powered by his magical reindeer, or cold-resistant, mythically powered, individually named animals, delivering presents to each child's house in the process. Santa is also expected to slide through chimneys to deliver these presents (homes not equipped with chimneys might ""leave the front door cracked open""), and children sometimes arrange cookies or other treats on a plate for him to enjoy.
Gifts are placed underneath a Christmas tree, or a pine tree that's decorated with ornaments and/or lights and is symbolic of the holiday. Additionally, smaller gifts may be placed inside a stocking, or a sock-shaped, holiday-specific piece of fabric that's generally hung on the mantle of a fireplace (homes without fireplaces might use the wall). A Christmas tree's ornaments, or hanging, typically spherical decorations, in addition to the mentioned lights, may be accompanied by a star, or a representation of the Star of Jerusalem that the Three Apostles followed while bringing Baby Jesus gifts and honoring him, in the Bible.

"Calling it a significant step forward for the alliance and European security, President Obama announced Friday that NATO will develop a missile defense system to safeguard most of Europe and the United States.
The agreement, according to the president, followed a year of talks to determine the best ways to coordinate efforts to protect members of the 61-year-old alliance.
The system would be strong enough to cover all NATO European territory and populations, as well as the United States, Obama told reporters in Lisbon, Portugal.
The missile defense plan offers a role for all of our allies in response to the threats of our times, the president said. It shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles. 
Obama addressed reporters during the first day of what he promised would be a landmark summit featuring leaders of NATO's 28 member countries, as well as Russia. By the time it wraps Saturday, the alliance aimed to produce a set of new initiatives intending to reinvigorate and redirect NATO 20 years after the end of the Cold War.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Friday that heads of state had agreed to a new mission statement, calling it the alliance's road map for the next 10 years. Crafting this so-called strategic concept had been a top priority of the meeting, which Rasmussen last month deemed one of the most important summits in the history of our alliance. 
 This strategic concept reconfirms the commitment by NATO members to defend one another against attack, and that will never change, Rasmussen said in Lisbon. But it also modernizes the way NATO does defense in the 21st century. 
The document, prepared from recommendations made by a panel led by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, sought to build upon NATO's work in Afghanistan to redefine the alliance as a global actor that would work with regional partners to combat threats outside Europe.
Under the new plan, NATO will bolster its role in counterinsurgency efforts, as well as the stabilization and reconstruction of key countries, according to Rasmussen. The defense alliance will also develop a standing capability to train local security forces and create a civilian arm to deal with other nations and groups.
Obama added Friday that NATO, under Rasmussen, was also looking at how to deal with threats like improvised explosives and cyber defenses, all serving a commitment that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. 
Afghanistan will be front and center on Saturday's agenda, with NATO members working with others who have committed resources to the nation and its government to align our approach, according to Obama. He said that includes having Afghan forces transition, between 2011 and 2014, taking over the security and governance mission in the country and forging a long-term partnership beyond that.
Russia's relationship with NATO and the United States is also a chief focus Saturday.
Obama said that starting then, NATO will work with Russia to build our cooperation with them in this area... recognizing that we share many of the same threats. 
In an exclusive interview with CNN's Chris Lawrence, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said he hoped that Russia's deepening partnership with NATO would cause Moscow to take a more civilized approach in dealing with its neighbors.
Russian troops have occupied Georgian territory since its invasion in 2008. Saakashvili, whose country's bid to join NATO has been stalled for several years, said that he hoped the alliance's involvement would prompt Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia.
 Once Russia becomes less paranoid, more cooperative, more self-confident in a nicer way -- because I think lots of things have emerged from their almost paranoid sense of insecurity -- hopefully, the small neighbors of Russia hopefully will feel themselves more safe, said Saakashvili, who met with Obama on Friday.
Obama reiterated his belief that the U.S. Congress should pass the New START nuclear control treaty, which the U.S. and Russia agreed on last spring but has not been ratified by either nation's legislatures. U.S. Senate Republicans have held up a vote on START, citing a heavy workload, in the lame duck session before a new Congress comes in next year, and concerns about the strength of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Obama said Friday that NATO leaders had called passage of the treaty -- which, among other things, would restart mutual nuclear inspections and limit the arsenal in the two countries -- critical to European and global security.
 A failure to ratify -LSB- this treaty -RSB-... will put at risk the substantial progress that has been made in advancing our nuclear security and our partnership with Russia, Obama said.
The search for a new mandate for the entire alliance comes at a time that 16 of the 28 NATO members have announced cuts in defense spending. NATO officials said leaders are expected to agree at the summit on a list of the top 10 spending priorities, including helicopters, transfer aircraft, technology to combat improvised explosive devices and increased medical capabilities.
The outcome of the war in Afghanistan is intrinsically tied to the future of the NATO alliance, a new analysis from the RAND Corporation suggested. The report, published Friday, warns that the U.S. lead in the war could undermine any future willingness to fight together if needed.
 In an alliance that finds achieving consensus is central, having one partner clearly overshadow all others highlights the real limits of the transatlantic alliance, the report said.
The difficulty and length of engagement will weigh on decisions by alliance members to intervene or aid in the future.
 The scope of NATO's future roles abroad may be more limited, such as focusing on humanitarian assistance or training, advising, and assisting nations that seek support. While these efforts may entail long-term commitments, they would fall well short of committing combat forces, wrote the RAND authors, Andrew Hoehn and Sarah Harting.
The new strategic concept will cite current security challenges facing NATO members in the 21st century, such as terrorism, cyber warfare and piracy.
Rasmussen has encouraged NATO members to be more agile in order to respond to 21st century threats and to continue to invest in military technology despite the global economic downturn. He urged allies to cut fat, not muscle and pool military spending.
The United States is pushing for a realignment of military spending priorities.
 We have proposed and hope to have accepted a set of capabilities that the alliance, in a time of dwindling resources, will decide it must fund, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told reporters earlier this week. Those are capabilities that deal with ongoing operations in Afghanistan, but also capabilities to deal with 21st century threats, including beefing up our cyberdefenses and embracing the deployment of missile defenses to protect European territory and populations against the growing threat of ballistic missiles. 
Obama also will hold a summit with European Union leaders, seeking to reaffirm a partnership with Europe that many feel has gone adrift as the United States expands its partnerships in Asia. Jobs and economic growth are expected to top the agenda at a time of growing tension between U.S. and European countries over the way to fix the global economy.
While the United States has pushed for stimulating economic expansion with more government spending, many European allies are tightening their belts.
The future of some 80,000 U.S. military forces in Europe will also be discussed. European leaders are looking for Obama to keep U.S. troops at their current levels, although the Obama administration has urged Europe to share more of the burden of its own defense.
CNN's Adam Levine contributed to this report.

"Some of the everyday heroes in the United States are the country's paramedics. These young men and women are usually the first people who respond to medical emergencies suffered by citizens. Paramedics must complete a very extensive physical training program that is designed to weed out those who cannot make the cut. A paramedic must be in fit condition, and be mentally strong to perform his or her duties in the face of danger. Many of these heroes must endure life-threatening situations when responding to emergencies. Paramedics are usually attached to a county, or city fire department, but there are also some private paramedic organizations.
 
In Southern California, there are two primary schools for paramedic training. They are UCLA's Daniel Freeman Paramedic program and the Paramedic Training Institute. Both of these schools provide candidates for the Los Angeles County and City Fire Departments. To become a paramedic for a county or city organization, candidates must also pass a psychological screening and a physical training program.
Some of the equipment paramedics carry is very specialized. They carry basic and advanced life support gear such as forcible entry tools so they can reach people in peril, saws to cut through obstacles, and other emergency equipment. Paramedics provide a valuable service to the communities they serve. They must be certified in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) techniques, and be trained to handle all situations.
Some paramedics are trained to respond to what is called Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI). These emergencies occur whenever there is a tragic event such as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the country, and other emergencies like earthquakes, mudslides, or floods. Paramedics can also be sent to emergency situations by citizens who call the 911 emergency phone number.","C2"
"Light propagating in the vicinity of astrophysical compact objects, like neutron stars and black holes, is affected by the gravitational field. It has been demonstrated that the general relativistic effects might be important for understanding the features of the radiation
coming from the neutron star like objects [1, 2, 3]. The
gravitational redshift and bending of light rays emitted
by a compact object affect the form and spectrum of the
observed signals. For the emission of light from the vicinity of a black hole these effects are more profound than
for neutron stars. For example, the line broadening of Xray observed by the ASCA satellite can be explained by
the strong gravitational effect on the light emitted from
the accretion disk located near to the central black hole
[4, 5].
Astrophysical black holes are believed to be formed
as a result of the gravitational collapse of massive stars
[6]. Then it is natural to expect that the radiation emitted during the gravitational collapse is also affected by
the strong gravity. For a spherical collapse and continuous emission of light this effect was studied in details
[7, 8, 9]. Recently the light curves for collapsing objects
were studied in a slightly different set up [10] assuming
that the radiation has a profile of a sharp in time pulse.
Such radiation may occur during the collapse of a star
when its matter density becomes much higher than the
nuclear density. Under these conditions hadronic phase
transitions are expected [11] which may result in sharpin-time emission of massless particles (photons and neutrino) [12].
In this work, we consider the radiation emitted by a
collapsing star during a finite time interval and calculate
light curves and the spectrum of this radiation as seen by
a distant observer. As in the previous work [10], we adopt
a simplified model of a freely falling spherical surface and
assume that the radiation is originally monochromatic.
But instead of instant radiation, we focus on the radiation emitted during the finite interval of time. The main
goal of this study is to analyze how one can extract information about the characteristics of a collapsing object

"According to Hartmann, an unbiased philosophical inquiry moves through the three main stages of phenomenological, aporetic and theoretical development. The first stage is descriptive and requires the systematic collection of all the available evidence relevant to whatever is under scrutiny. More often than not, descriptions end up in conflicting theses, often in the form of aporias. More than anybody else, Hartmann rehabilitates the value of aporias (for two recent evaluations of Hartmann’s aporetic method see Schlittmaier 2011 and Rescher 2011). Aporias themselves are informative and should not be forced to disappear by fiat decisions, such as an a priori assumption on the overall consistency of reality or the assumption that we have a direct, transparent access to reality. The last phase of the philosophical method consists in using as few metaphysical assumptions as possible for the systematic coordination of the outcomes from the first two phases (E, S).
Metaphysical assumptions are necessary for the task of incorporating aporias into a framework able to make sense of them. Since metaphysical assumptions are not directly supported by descriptive data, it is advisable to keep them to a minimum, or to assume the weakest possible metaphysical assumptions.
An original way of distinguishing between ontology and metaphysics underlies the third stage of theoretical development. Ontology, for Hartmann, deals with what can be subsumed under at least partially representable categories (see Section 3 below). Two main consequences follow from this view of ontology: firstly, ontology is primarily a theory of categories, in the sense that all ontological distinctions have the form of categories (A.Intro1), and secondly, science in all its branches is the most successful and powerful ally of ontology. More precisely, for Hartmann science is ontological in all its ramifications (G.37a). This is rather at odds with the mainstream view of science as an eminently epistemological affair. This is one of the issues on which Hartmann firmly departs from the Kantian—to be precise, the Neo-Kantian—legacy. The claim that the main orientation of science is ontological immediately entails that scientific categories are further specifications and subdivisions of ontological categories. In other words, the contact with science is a characteristic feature of the theory of categories, and therefore of ontology (A.Intro1). The philosopher’s task is to unfold the first and most general articulations of the theory of categories, while scientists deal with their subsequent further specifications.","C2"
"Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or ""the calculus of infinitesimals"", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.
It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1]
Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.[4]
In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally ""small pebble"" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.
Differential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the derivative of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called differentiation. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the derivative function or just the derivative of the original function. In formal terms, the derivative is a linear operator which takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function—such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on—and uses this information to produce another function. The function produced by deriving the squaring function turns out to be the doubling function.
In more explicit terms the ""doubling function"" may be denoted by g(x) = 2x and the ""squaring function"" by f(x) = x2. The ""derivative"" now takes the function f(x), defined by the expression ""x2"", as an input, that is all the information—such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on—and uses this information to output another function, the function g(x) = 2x, as will turn out.
The most common symbol for a derivative is an apostrophe-like mark called prime. Thus, the derivative of a function called f is denoted by f′, pronounced ""f prime"". For instance, if f(x) = x2 is the squaring function, then f′(x) = 2x is its derivative (the doubling function g from above). This notation is known as Lagrange's notation.
If the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For example, if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the velocity of the ball.","C2"
"Deep reinforcement learning is poised to revolutionise the field of AI and represents a step towards building
autonomous systems with a higher level understanding of the
visual world. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement
learning to scale to problems that were previously intractable,
such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. Deep
reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics,
allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from
camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with
an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning,
then progress to the main streams of value-based and policybased methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in
deep reinforcement learning, including the deep Q-network,
trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage
actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of
deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via
reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current
areas of research within the field.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the primary goals of the field of artificial intelligence
(AI) is to produce fully autonomous agents that interact with
their environments to learn optimal behaviours, improving over
time through trial and error. Crafting AI systems that are
responsive and can effectively learn has been a long-standing
challenge, ranging from robots, which can sense and react
to the world around them, to purely software-based agents,
which can interact with natural language and multimedia.
A principled mathematical framework for experience-driven
autonomous learning is reinforcement learning (RL) [135]. Although RL had some successes in the past [141, 129, 62, 93],
previous approaches lacked scalablity and were inherently
limited to fairly low-dimensional problems. These limitations
exist because RL algorithms share the same complexity issues as other algorithms: memory complexity, computational
complexity, and in the case of machine learning algorithms,
sample complexity [133]. What we have witnessed in recent
years—the rise of deep learning, relying on the powerful
function approximation and representation learning properties
of deep neural networks—has provided us with new tools to
overcoming these problems.
The advent of deep learning has had a significant impact
on many areas in machine learning, dramatically improving
the state-of-the-art in tasks such as object detection, speech
recognition, and language translation [70]. The most important
property of deep learning is that deep neural networks can
automatically find compact low-dimensional representations
(features) of high-dimensional data (e.g., images, text and
audio). Through crafting inductive biases into neural network
architectures, particularly that of hierarchical representations,
machine learning practitioners have made effective progress
in addressing the curse of dimensionality [15]. Deep learning
has similarly accelerated progress in RL, with the use of
deep learning algorithms within RL defining the field of
“deep reinforcement learning” (DRL). The aim of this survey
is to cover both seminal and recent developments in DRL,
conveying the innovative ways in which neural networks can
be used to bring us closer towards developing autonomous
agents. For a more comprehensive survey of recent efforts in
DRL, including applications of DRL to areas such as natural
language processing [106, 5], we refer readers to the overview
by Li [78].
Deep learning enables RL to scale to decision-making
problems that were previously intractable, i.e., settings with
high-dimensional state and action spaces. Amongst recent
work in the field of DRL, there have been two outstanding
success stories. The first, kickstarting the revolution in DRL,
was the development of an algorithm that could learn to play
a range of Atari 2600 video games at a superhuman level,
directly from image pixels [84]. Providing solutions for the
instability of function approximation techniques in RL, this
work was the first to convincingly demonstrate that RL agents
could be trained on raw, high-dimensional observations, solely
based on a reward signal. The second standout success was
the development of a hybrid DRL system, AlphaGo, that
defeated a human world champion in Go [128], paralleling the
historic achievement of IBM’s Deep Blue in chess two decades
earlier [19] and IBM’s Watson DeepQA system that beat the
best human Jeopardy! players [31]. Unlike the handcrafted
rules that have dominated chess-playing systems, AlphaGo
was composed of neural networks that were trained using
supervised and reinforcement learning, in combination with
a traditional heuristic search algorithm.
DRL algorithms have already been applied to a wide range
of problems, such as robotics, where control policies for robots
can now be learned directly from camera inputs in the real
world [74, 75], succeeding controllers that used to be handengineered or learned from low-dimensional features of the
robot’s state. In a step towards even more capable agents,
DRL has been used to create agents that can meta-learn (“learn
to learn”) [29, 156], allowing them to generalise to complex
visual environments they have never seen before [29]. In
Figure 1, we showcase just some of the domains that DRL
has been applied to, ranging from playing video games [84]
to indoor navigation [167].
Video games may be an interesting challenge, but learning
how to play them is not the end goal of DRL. One of the
driving forces behind DRL is the vision of creating systems
that are capable of learning how to adapt in the real world.
From managing power consumption [142] to picking and
stowing objects [75], DRL stands to increase the amount
of physical tasks that can be automated by learning. However, DRL does not stop there, as RL is a general way of
approaching optimisation problems by trial and error. From
designing state-of-the-art machine translation models [168] to
constructing new optimisation functions [76], DRL has already
been used to approach all manner of machine learning tasks","C2"
"An American man has been detained in North Korea, two State Department officials told CNN.
Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of not being identified said the man is a Korean-American businessman. One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea.
The State Department is working with the Swedish Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, the officials said. The United States is urging North Korean authorities, through the Swedes, to release the man on humanitarian grounds.
Sweden represents America's interests in North Korea because the United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.
The Swedes have been granted consular access to the man and have visited him, the officials said. The Swedes are asking for regular visits, the officials said.
A Swedish official in Stockholm confirmed to CNN that the embassy in Pyongyang is working on the case.
The sources declined to provide additional information because of privacy concerns.
North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington.
In 2010, former President Jimmy Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who had been fined roughly $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea.
Gomes, who attempted to commit suicide while in North Korean custody, was believed to be a Christian activist.
Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had entered North Korea in March 2009 and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August 2009 after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear development program. The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February, despite North Korea's warning to the South not to carry out the drills, calling them a provocation and threatening to engulf Seoul in a sea of flames. 
South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors, and last November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.
